A man of action as well as an artist, he took part in the Sack of Rome in 1527; he was temperamental, passionate, and conceited, capable of committing criminal acts ranging from brawling and sodomy to theft and murder.

This narrative account, from the earliest cave paintings up to the present day, has new things to say about almost every period of art. Taking account of changing scholarship and shifting opinions, he draws our attention to a number of neglected artists and styles, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, Russia and the Americas. <p>Paul Johnson puts the creative originality of the individual at the heart of his story. He pays particular attention to key periods: the emergence of the artistic personality in the Renaissance, the new realism of the early seventeenth century, the discovery of landscape painting as a separate art form, and the rise of ideological art. He notes the division of ''fashion art'' and fine art at the beginning of the twentieth century, and how it has now widened. <p>Though challenging and controversial, Paul Johnson is not primarily a revisionist. He is a passionate lover of beauty who finds creativity in many places. With 300 colour illustrations, this book is vivid, evocative and immensely readable, whether the author is describing the beauty of Egyptian low-relief carving or the medieval cathedrals of Europe, the watercolours of Thomas Girtin or the utility of Roman bridges (''the best bridges in history''), the genius of Andrew Wyeth or the tranquility of the Great Mosque at Damascus, the paintings of Ilya Repin or a carpet-page from the Lindisfarne Gospels.

The poetry and biblical inspiration of his paintings have always appealed to a broad public and his works are popular amongst collectors all over the world. <p>Chagall continued, in his paintings, to invoke his birthplace of Vitebsk, with its strong Jewish traditions, customs and everyday life, even long after he moved to Paris permanently in 1923. Picasso once said: "Since the death of Matisse, Chagall has been the only artist to really understand the true nature of colour. His oil paintings are really painted, not just put together... no artist since Renoir has had such a feeling for light as Chagall." <p>Chagall''s best paintings, gouaches, water-colours, graphic works, sculptures, pottery, mosaics and tapestries, together with his works for the theatre, opera and ballet, are reproduced in full colour in this book.

Instead there is a singular reinterpretation of the neoclassical vocabulary: floral motifs, acanthus scrolls, and garlands or drops. Care for detail in these architectural motifs-often in three dimensions-is paramount. At the same time, Cartier introduced the use of platinum for the mounts. This metal was more solid and more luminous but also harder to work. It required a revolution in setting techniques as well as new tools and underlying techniques. Layer by layer, these foundation designs raised Cartier to the position of visionary and pioneer.Specialists, collectors, fans of Cartier objects, and those who love decorative arts will discover a surprising new view of Cartier in this major catalog.', 'Art'),

It establishes that his form of art-embedded in communitarian practices like kirtan, alpona, pet-naming, syncretism, and storytelling through oral allegories-sought a social identity within the inter-subjective context of locality, regionality, nationality, and trans-nationality.

The concurrent upheavals in Western art driven by the advent of modernism provided Indian artists in post-1920 India a powerful tool of colonial resistance. Distinguished art historian Partha Mitter now explores in this brilliantly illustrated study this lesser known facet of Indian art and history.<br> Taking the 1922 Bauhaus exhibition in Calcutta as the debut of European modernism in India, "The Triumph of Modernism" probes the intricate interplay of Western modernism and Indian nationalism in the evolution of colonial-era Indian art. Mitter casts his gaze across a myriad of issues, including the emergence of a feminine voice in Indian art, the decline of "oriental art," and the rise of naturalism and modernism in the 1920s. Nationalist politics also played a large role, from the struggle of artists in reconciling Indian nationalism with imperial patronage of the arts to the relationship between primitivism and modernism in Indian art. An engagingly written study anchored by 150 lush reproductions, "The Triumph of Modernism" will be essential reading for scholars of art, British studies, and Indian history.<br>', 'Art'),

Flusser has written the definitive book on how men should dress, how they can be stylish without being fashion victims, and how they can feel secure and confident in whatever they wear, wherever they go. Luxuriously illustrated with vintage photos.<br>"Dressing the Man" is the definitive guide to what men need to know in order to dress well and look stylish without becoming fashion victims. <p>Alan Flusser''s name is synonymous with taste and style. With his new book, he combines his encyclopedic knowledge of men''s clothes with his signature wit and elegance to address the fundamental paradox of modern men''s fashion: Why, after men today have spent more money on clothes than in any other period of history, are there fewer well-dressed men than at any time ever before? <p>According to Flusser, dressing well is not all that difficult, the real challenge lies in being able to acquire the right personalized instruction. Dressing well pivots on two pillars -- proportion and color. Flusser believes that "Permanent Fashionability," both his promise and goal for the reader, starts by being accountable to a personal set of physical trademarks and not to any kind of random, seasonally served-up collection of fashion flashes. <p>Unlike fashion, which is obliged to change each season, the face''s shape, the neck''s height, the shoulder''s width, the arm''s length, the torso''s structure, and the foot''s size remain fairly constant over time. Once a man learns how to adapt the fundamentals of permanent fashion to his physique and complexion, he''s halfway home. <p>Taking the reader through each major clothing classification step-by-step, this user-friendly guide helps you apply your own specifics to a series of dressing options, from business casual and formalwear to pattern-on-pattern coordination, or how to choose the most flattering clothing silhouette for your body type and shirt collar for your face. <p>A man''s physical traits represent hisindividual road map, and the quickest route toward forging an enduring style of dress is through exposure to the legendary practitioners of this rare masculine art. Flusser has assembled the largest andmost diverse collection of stylishly mantled men ever found in one book. Many never-before-seen vintage photographs from the era of Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire are employed to help illustrate the range and diversity of authentic men''s fashion. "Dressing the Man"''s sheer magnitude of options will enable the reader to expand both the grammar and verbiage of his permanent-fashion vocabulary. <p>For those men hoping to find sartorial fulfillment somewhere down the road, tethering their journey to the mind-set of permanent fashion will deliver them earlier rather than later in life.', 'Art'),

The murals were created using only the glow of lamps and candles quite unlike the harsh light employed in modern professional photography. For this book, Benoy K. Behl has used long exposures that pick up natural ambient light, capturing the art for the first time in all its glory and luminosity. The early followers of the Buddha created an isolated haven where they could meditate in peace. Stonecutters carved out massive caves decorated with lithe and graceful figures, fashioning beams and rafters from the rock in imitation of wooden buildings. Painters worked on exquisite murals that depict scenes of princely processions, ladies with their handmaidens, bejeweled animals, ascetics in monasteries, fantastic birds and beasts all demonstrating a startling degree of sophistication. Ajanta provides virtually the only evidence remaining of painting styles that first developed in India and then traveled with the spread of Buddhism into the Himalayan region, across Central Asia into China, and from there to Japan and Korea.', 'Art'),

At the dawn of art, representations of the nude body focused almost entirely on fertility, with some cultures explicit and others rather more prudish about representing the unclothed body. With the coming of Christianity, representations of the nude became associated with the idea of the Fall of Man and original sin. This conflicted with the need to show nude or nearly nude bodies when representing episodes from the Passion of Christ and the martyrdoms of popular saints. These tensions have been inherited in ever more complex form by modern society. Today, representations of the nude remain a battleground, fought over by libertarians and anti-libertarians. Most recently, feminism has challenged images of the female nude, while an increasing moral panic now restricts the depiction of the naked child - images which would have been commonplace in the art of the Renaissance. Censoring the Body exposes our bodies and our ideas about our bodies, revealing the complex historical and cultural legacies which frame - and obscure - our vision.Manifestos for the Twenty-First Century is a Seagull series ceated in collaboration with the Index on Censorship, a home and voice for freedom and expression since it was founded in 1972', 'Art'),

Behind this prodigious output, rivaling even Picasso''s, is a lifetime of struggle and anguish seldom hinted at in the work of this "happy painter." His efforts to find a new art to match his vision of the world created by light and warmth are vividly and intimately chronicled here through his letters and those of his friends and patrons. <br>Barbara Ehrlich White, a renowned Renoir scholar, devoted more than twenty years to searching out unpublished letters and documents that reveal his life as an artist and as a man. First published in 1984, her book was praised for its comprehensive yet intimate history of Renoir''s life and work. Now back in print, White''s classic book brilliantly contrasts the story of Renoir''s personal battle against crippling arthritis--as well as his loss of favor with old patrons dissatisfied when he developed a new style--with the joyous gratification of the senses that flows from his canvases. She captures both the underlying traditionalism of his training and his audacious breakthrough in style, subject, and technique. This uniquely documented tribute to Renoir, with its lavish illustrations, including three gatefolds--, is the essential Renoir. <br>THE NEW YORK TIMES, Books of the Times, November 28, 1984, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt: "One of the two most impressive art books of the year ....

This edition reflects upon the economic, social, and cultural problems of the time, but also shows how the force of the avant-garde continued to thrive in Italy, Switzerland, Scandinavia and the USA.

Their image making was followed in detail and their personality was studied in a long clinical interview, producing a rich, individual picture of the style and substance of the inner life of each. Then the images were grouped into seven types by cluster analysis. The personal data were found to fit the image clusters closely: for example, images with little form and much narration were produced by people with strong compensatory longings, while dense, collaged images were made by participants who exercised relentless control over one major issue in their life. Other individuals had a strong need to integrate their lives and produced well-formed, well-composed images.

Dominic Lopes confronts the puzzle of how the value of seeing<br>anything in a picture can exceed that of seeing it face to face--his solution pinpoints how seeing-in is like and unlike ordinary seeing. Moreover, since part of what we see in pictures is emotional expressions, his book also develops a theory of expression especially tailored to pictures. <br>Not all evaluations of pictures as opportunities for seeing-in are aesthetic--others are cognitive or moral. Lopes argues that these evaluations interact, for some imply others. His argument entails novel conceptions of aesthetic and cognitive evaluation, such that aesthetic evaluation is<br>distinguished from art evaluation as essentially tied to experience, and that cognitive evaluations assess cognitive capacities, including perceptual ones. Ultimately, Lopes defends images against the widespread criticism that they thwart serious thought, especially moral thought, because they<br>merely replicate ordinary experience. He concludes by presenting detailed case studies of the contribution pictures can make to moral reflection. <br>Sight and Sensibility will be essential reading for anyone working in aesthetics and art theory, and for all those intrigued by the power of images to affect our lives.', 'Art'),

Has the architect, in attempting to accomodate individual client wishes, created spaces in which the residents can develop and thrive? Or have these private spheres become constricting and prison-like? Did plans go sour once they were turned into built reality? Drawing on 7 examples of single-family dwellings built in Switzerland and the United States, Zoelly confronts, head-on, an architect''s good intentions with the actual experiences of the people who were to live in his finished products. The homeowners'' perception of life ''at home'' is juxtaposed with photographs that capture their lifestyles from the visitor''s-eye view. The result is a finely-tuned, self-critical account of the kind all too rarely carried out by architects today.', 'Art'),

Dr. Noble has assembled a remarkable collection of 153 reproductions printed in black and white, arranged with oral histories, letters and other commentaries to give the reader a more intimate understanding of the combat soldier who served in Vietnam and what he had to endure. Forgotten Warriors is not intended to argue the merits of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia. Rather, through the visual impact of the illustrations, the soldiers themselves express what the Vietnam experience was like in a way that is different and more profound than perhaps any other work on the subject. The main focus of the book is on the way artists saw the world of the "grunt": patrols, life in the rear, fighting the terrain and weather, tests of endurance, the machines of war and the effects of combat and its aftermath. The reader is also given a sense of how some writers and artists felt about the country and the people of South Vietnam. To date, our perceptions of the Vietnam war have been influenced largely by movies, television and novels. Recognizing this, Dr. Noble enlisted Professor William J. Palmer, a noted authority on the media and their reportage fo the war, to provide an essay that allows the reader to compare his or her past impressions with the art works contained in this book. A moving collection, Forgotten Warriors offers the truest picture of the Vietnam war in human terms.', 'Art'),

They represent, for example, the fragmentation of identity through images of amputation, the arbitrary construction of identity through games of chance, the struggle within the writing self to resist censorship in East Germany, and the protest against a culturally imposed identity based on racial categorization.<p>The volume''s eleven articles address issues of multiculturalism, national and personal identity, and avant-garde art, and reflect on the various ways gender and culture interact in the German context.', 'Art'),

The author''s reading of aesthetic texts alongside urban planning, economics, sociology, law, and historiography--discourses he treats as form-producing arts in their own right--shows as misleading the common dichotomy of models that focus on the structure of urban space and institutions, and those that describe cities as fluid constellations of social practices.<br>The ideal of mobility was invoked early in this century by the urban pluralists of the Chicago School, who reasoned that the greater diversity and lighter attachments among urbanites would make the city a zone in which people might realize themselves by pursuit of "their particular vices or talents." It also was hailed by the Progressives, who sought through techniques of social management to foster democracy, to reform the material conditions of urban life, and to make cities more efficient centers of production and cultural reproduction. Urban Verbs elucidates the different kinds of cities these ideals of mobility produce. <br>', 'Art'),

He had good grounds for the confidence palpable in his statement, for in the history of 20th century art, his name stands out over all the others. In Picasso''s paintings, drawings, lithographs, ceramics, and sculptures, he was tirelessly inventive and innovative, exhibiting an aesthetic bravado that kept him one step ahead of his contemporaries. From subject matter to new forms and techniques to new media, Picasso got there first. The Spanish artist''s enormous output, from the eight-year-old''s beginnings to the late work of a man of ninety-one, is surely one of the most diverse and creatively energetic in the whole history of art, and it is no exaggeration to see him as the genius of the century. Carsten-Peter Warncke''s study is a thorough review of Picasso''s entire oeuvre, from the early Blue and Rose Periods, through the analytic and synthetic cubism and classicist phase all the way up to the art of the old savage Picasso.

While reams have been written about Italian architects and designers, until now no volume has ever been dedicated to those who contributed to their success. <p>This book takes a behind-the-scenes look at the manufacturers who made possible the most important modern and contemporary furnishings, who risked and invested in innovative products, many of which have become icons of design; and who first believed in a new form of elegance. <p>In a detailed historical analysis from the 1950s to today, Stefano Casciani follows the career paths of the manufacturing movers and shakers of the design world, all of whom are depicted in striking black-and-white portraits by the Norwegian photographer Tom Sandberg. These portraits of entrepreneurs such as Bruno Danese, Giulio Cappellini and Patrizia Moroso tell of the individual and collective experience of constructing the image of Italian design worldwide. From the Luisa chair by Poggi to the Thinking Man''s chair by Cappellini, from the Tizio lamp by Artemide to the Glo-ball by Flos, the text discusses the past and present of the various entrepreneurial histories and the development of the culture of Italian design.

A marginal artistic pursuit by choice as well as necessity, performance art has flourished in and about "multicentric" Los Angeles for nearly four decades, finding its own centers of activity, moving and changing as the margins have reconstituted themselves. The notion of multicentricity serves, somewhat paradoxically, as the unifying motif in Cheng''s imaginative views of center and periphery, self and other, and "mainstream" and "marginal" cultures. She analyzes individual artists and performances in detail, bringing her own "center" gracefully and unmistakably into contact with all those others. Without suggesting that her approach is definitive, she offers a way of thinking and talking coherently about particularly elusive, ephemeral artwork.<br>Cheng describes performance art as "an intermedia visual art form that uses theatrical elements in presentation." Performance art, which uses the living body as its central medium, occurs only "here" and only "now." Because it is intentionally volatile, highly adaptable, and often site-specific, with emphasis on audience interaction, context is inseparable from the work itself. When Cheng writes about Suzanne Lacy or Tim Miller, Johanna Went or Oguri and Renzoku, Sacred Naked Nature Girls or osseus labyrint, she is conscious of her role in extending their creative expression.<br>As members of the "virtual audience," readers and viewers of other documentation concerning performance art are arrayed outside the center represented by a given artist and the circle represented by the immediatewitnesses to a performance, but all may entertain what Cheng calls a conceptual ownership of the work. A person who reads about a performance, she says, may feel more affected by this virtual encounter than a person who has seen it live, and may reimagine it as a "prosthetic performance." Cheng''s writing draws us into the many centers where a vibrant contemporary art phenomenon and a fascinating urban environment interact.<br>"Published in association with the Southern California Studies Center at the University of Southern California"', 'Art'),

It shows how design originates in &lsquo;human need&rsquo; which is not only physical but also psychological, socio-cultural, ecological and spiritual. The book calls for broad-based, socially integrated designs with a large global vision. The need of the day, it underlines, is the designing of strategies to offer creative solutions to a variety of subjects rather than providing multiplicity of objects. Exploring the course taken by design during the time of Gandhi and in the following era, the author advocates the need for service- or process-oriented designs in contrast to product-oriented designs. The book also showcases 13 design case studies that have done just that.<br /><br />The book explores the intricate and multifarious relationship between the design activity and the product in the Indian context, exploring the history of traditional design and its evolution. On one hand it takes the reader through the cultural-roots of design, and, on the other, it also explores new technologies and their applications in design.<br /><br />A remarkable feature of the book is the way its narrative is enlivened with case studies detailing design inventions, interspersed with tales of Mullah Nasiruddin that provide a tongue-in-cheek take on aspects of design. It is sprinkled with pictures that show the many faces and aspects of design.<br /><br />This book will be an insightful reference for design professionals, academics and students in institutes conducting research on design and for those in the industrial/technical design departments of Engineering colleges.</p>', 'Art'),

Designers can refer to examples for every category of graphics, from direct mail to information graphics, and for a variety of sectors from leisure and the arts to manufacturing and the law. For the finale, witty designers answer the big question: how did they get the idea? They offer a peep into their private working methods, as they check out word lists, look at things sideways, or put several jobs on the table at once. Gathering together the best examples of graphic wit over the past three decades, A Smile in the Mind shows work from over 300 designers in the USA, Britain, Europe and Japan.<br>This book explores witty thinking -- the most entertaining area of graphic design. Witty thinking is playfulness with ideas, words playing against images, unexpected connections prompting new insights. It is clever thinking, not funny drawing.<p>A Smile in the Mind analyses the thought processes behind the images. It shows how to make the case for witty solutions and, through a series of interviews with the world''s top designers, suggests how to get ideas. Gathering together the best examples of graphic wit over the past three decades, this book includes work from over 300 designers in the USA, Britain, Europe and Japan. Written with insight and a lightness of touch, it offers designers a friendly read, a helpful sourcebook and a trigger for ideas.', 'Art'),

The essays address the problems surrounding the photograph''s ostensible "factuality"-its presumed ability to represent the real world-and suggest the difficulties inherent in aestheticizing the real into fictive forms, while also examining how the photograph shaped and reflected the new, modern artistic self-consciousness of figures such as Alfred Stieglitz, Vanessa Bell, and Willa Cather.

Tracing conceptual networks among mid-century intellectuals, and the impact of French existentialism on artists such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman, Nancy Jachec reinterprets the international success of Abstract Expressionism. She argues that American avant-garde painting was promoted by the United States government, not because of its affinities with American values, but rather because of its radical character which was considered to appeal to a Western European populace perceived by the State Department as inclined toward Socialism. Bringing together the histories of art, philosophy and politics of postwar America, this interdisciplinary study uses previously unpublished archival materials to examine systematically the influence of European philosophy on America''s first internationally recognized avant-garde art form.</p>', 'Art'),

Cranston also analyzes the term ''portrait'' as it is used in contemporary literature, which describes a resemblance of minds and affections between the sitter and the viewer derived from encounters, such as speaker and listener, lover and beloved, and self and other. Bringing together a wide range of literary and visual sources and applying methods derived from literary theory and structural analysis, this study demonstrates how sixteenth-century portraits extend contemporary efforts to perceive and receive painting as a kind of poetry.</p>', 'Art'),

But the first and most valuable treasures they looted were the Crown Jewels of the Holy Roman Empire. In "Hitler''s Holy Relics, "bestselling author Sidney Kirkpatrick tells the riveting and never-before-told true story of how an American college professor turned Army sleuth recovered these cherished symbols of Hitler''s Thousand-Year Reich before they could become a rallying point in the creation of a Fourth and equally unholy Reich.<p>Anticipating the Allied invasion of Nazi Germany, Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler had ordered a top-secret bunker carved deep into the bedrock beneath Nurnberg castle. Inside the well-guarded chamber was a specially constructed vault that held the plundered treasures Hitler valued the most: the Spear of Destiny (reputed to have been used to pierce Christ''s side while he was on the cross) and the Crown Jewels of the Holy Roman Empire, ancient artifacts steeped in medieval mysticism and coveted by world rulers from Charlemagne to Napoleon. But as Allied bombers rained devastation upon Nurnberg and the U.S. Seventh Army prepared to invade the city Hitler called "the soul of the Nazi Party," five of the most precious relics, all central to the coronation ceremony of a would-be Holy Roman Emperor, vanished from the vault. Who took them? And why? The mystery remained unsolved for months after the war''s end, until the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, ordered Lieutenant Walter Horn, a German-born art historian on leave from U.C. Berkeley, to hunt down the missing treasures.To accomplish his mission, Horn must revisit the now-rubble-strewn landscape of his youth and delve into the ancient legends and arcane mysticism surrounding the antiquities that Hitler had looted in his quest for world domination. Horn searches for clues in the burnt remains of Himmler''s private castle and follows the trail of neo-Nazi "Teutonic Knights" charged with protecting a vast hidden fortune in plundered gold and other treasure. Along the way, Horn has to confront his own demons: how members of his family and former academic colleagues subverted scholarly research to help legitimize Hitler''s theories of Aryan supremacy and the Master Race. What Horn discovers on his investigative odyssey is so explosive that his final report will remain secret for decades. <p>Drawing on unpublished interrogation and intelligence reports, as well as on diaries, letters, journals, and interviews in the United States and Germany, Kirkpatrick tells this riveting and disturbing story with cinematic detail and reveals-- for the first time--how a failed Vienna art student, obsessed with the occult and dreams of his own grandeur, nearly succeeded in creating a Holy Reich rooted in a twisted reinvention of medieval and Church history.', 'Art'),

Apart from the making of his personal history and his times, it leads us to why the act of making (art) itself takes on such a fundamental philosophical significance in his life. This, the author explains, derives directly from his absorption of Gandhi ''s philosophy that looked at the act of making or doing as an ethical ideal, and further back to the impact of the Arts and Crafts Movement on the ideology of Swadeshi and on the milieu of Santiniketan.</p>  <p>This book examines his art along with his role in political activism which, although garnered on Indian soil made him crisscross national borders and assume an important role in the international arena of war resistance. Devi Prasad graduated from Tagore ''s Santiniketan in 1944 when he joined the Hindustani Talimi Sangh (which promulgated Nayee Taleem) at Gandhi ''s ashram Sevagram as Art Teacher . His political consciousness saw him participate actively in the Quit India Movement in 1942, in Vinoba Bhave ''s Bhoodan and later from 1962 onward as Secretary General (later Chairman) of the War Resisters International, the oldest world pacifist organisation based in London. From there he was able to extend his Gandhian values internationally. All of this, while continuing with his life as a prolific artist. Rather than view them as separate worlds or professions, Devi harmonises them within an ethical and conscionable whole. He has written widely on the inextricable link between peace and creativity, on child /basic education, Gandhi and Tagore, on politics and art, in English, Hindi and Bangla. In 2007 he was awarded the Lalit Kala Akademi Ratna and in 2008, the Desikottama by Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan.</p>', 'Art'),

For example, the glass lens allowed more lifelike portraiture in the early Renaissance, the ability to put paint into tubes gave the Impressionists the freedom to work outdoors, and Freud''s work in psychoanalysis had a major impact on Surrealism. <p> The second part of the book explores enduring Themes of art, taking a subject and showing how artists through the ages have depicted it. Various approaches to portraits and landscapes, allegory and religion, still life andabstraction are compared and contrasted, using carefully selected images to illuminate each point made. <p> In addition, an extensive Reference section allows the reader to access information in numerous ways; the multiple indices include a glossary of terms, artists registry, index of museums, and more. <p> With easy navigation and an engaging presentation of the material, The Collins Big Book of Art will inform, inspire, and entertain art enthusiasts at any level of understanding and appreciation.', 'Art'),

This moment--both banal and ominous--stayed with him until it worked its way into his art. The result is "Fingerprint," a visual fable that celebrates resistance to state surveillance and control. The artist''s fingerprints, letter-pressed onto the pages of the book, create progressively complex patterns and sequences, transporting the fingerprint from the world of forensics and law into the freeing world of art and imagination.</p>  <p>Playful yet provoking, this is a timely and many-layered visual tale that is both a work of art and a political communique. "Fingerprint" meshes the line between art and politics, contextualizing barriers and checkpoints through a historical and theoretical consideration of the politics and ethics of identity management. An accompanying essay by historian and political activist V. Geetha points to those suggestive instances when people across cultures and nations have resisted fingerprinting, asserting their right to existence while fighting all attempts to foreclose their identities.

Neumayer documents narrative picture sequences in line-drawings, while at the same time including close-up photos of details. This helps to provide a fairly accurate idea of crucial figures, details of implements, among others. For the picture panels on rocks, line drawings--prepared at the spot--and octal photographs have been chosen to clarify their interpretations. Further, pictures of well-preserved paintings have been reproduced in full. <br>quipped with a companion CD containing the author''s drawings from all major rock art sites across the country, this volume will appeal to rock art scholars, students of art and archeology, as well as general readers.', 'Art'),

This is the only introduction to Romanticism that incorporates not only the English but the Continental movements, and not only literature but music, art, religion, and philosophy. Balancing lively details with intriguing topics, it sheds light on such subjects as the "Sensibility" movement, which preceded Romanticism; the rising prestige of the poet as inspired prophet; the suffering and neglect of the poet; the rather different figure of the "poetess"; Romanticism as a religious trend; Romantic philosophy and science; and Romantic responses to the French Revolution, the Orient, gypsies, and the condition of women. Ferber offers a definition and several general propositions about this very diverse movement, as well as a discussion of the word "Romantic" and where it came from. Finally, some two hundred authors or artists are cited or quoted, many at length, including Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Emerson, Hugo, Goethe, Pushkin, Beethoven, Berlioz, Chopin, and Delacroix.', 'Art'),

But the destruction of the Jewish fashion industry in Germany and Austria adds an astounding new chapter to the story. Here, Roberta S. Kremer traces the wanton destruction of a thriving fashion industry whose impact on German high fashion was regarded by the Reich as being too heavily influenced by Jewish designers, manufacturers, and merchandisers. The emergence of ready-to-wear and the development of the modern department store with its innovative merchandising and lavish interior design attracted the attention of the Nazis, who proceeded with a campaign of boycotts, humiliation, and Aryanization. "Broken Threads" includes photographs and fashion plates that tragically illustrate the social and cultural losses suffered during this period.', 'Art'),

In doing so, Lewis has shed new light on Cezanne as an artist of his own time and place.', 'Art'),

In reality, Islanders use of foreign cloth and clothing generally involved translating indigenous preoccupations into new forms of dress. Today, both imported and indigenous cloth feature prominently in Pacific Island exchange, religious practice, clothing, domestic space, public political activity, festivals, and the art and tourist markets. This book sets out to examine the multiple histories of cloth and clothing in the Pacific and to investigate its role in social innovation and resistance from the period of contact to the present day.The past three decades have witnessed the emergence of Pacific fashion stylists as well as cloth producers who, like anthropologists, are acutely aware of how globalization impacts on identity. Typically, their work integrates both Pacific and introduced forms. This book compares these synthetic forms with others that developed in the region during the colonial period, when foreign cloth was typically adapted and incorporated within indigenous textile systems, and shows how cloth is central to the transmission of identity as well as a vehicle for associative thinking. From an analysis of the place of cloth in traditional Tahitian religion, to fashion activism within the diaspora population in New Zealand, Clothing the Pacific provides fascinating insights into the shifting relationship between cloth and social imagination. By tracing the diverse responses to the imposition of dress upon Pacific Islanders, this book profoundly challenges Western assumptions about the place of cloth in culture.', 'Art'),

Many of the images present the gods and heroes as ridiculous and ugly. While the narrative content of some images may appear to be trivial, others address issues that are deeply serious. When placed against the background of the religious beliefs and social frameworks from which they spring, these images allow us to explore questions relating to their meaning in particular communities. Throughout, we see indications that Greek vase-painters developed their own comedic narratives and visual jokes. The images enhance our understanding of Greek society in just the same way as their more sober siblings in serious art.

From Carlyle''s fantastical character Professor Teufelsdrockh, through the first Freudian analysis of clothes by J.C.

Must we revertto a default dichotomy between utopia and desolation, the notion that media, evendigital media, by themselves can redeem or damn us?

Focusinginstead on the later, classicizing prints of the 1930s, this book offers a radicallydifferent view of Picasso and the "classical" -- a view that aligns his work muchmore closely with Surrealist, and specifically Bataillean, revisions ofantiquity.The book''s argument is built around detailed analyses of several separateprint series: Picasso''s illustrations for Ovid''s Metamorphoses, the etchings of theVollard Suite, and The Minotauromachy. Common to all of them, the book shows, is astrong engagement not only with the classical, but with the viewer. In the latter, Picasso''s prints are clearly at odds with the understanding of the relationshipbetween classical art and its audience that prevailed throughout most of thenineteenth and twentieth centuries -- an understanding that held the work''spurported autonomy to mirror the viewer''s own. By exposing that autonomy as afantasy, Picasso opens the "classical" work and its viewer alike to theentanglements of desire and the dissolution of boundaries it inevitably brings.Muchof the argument turns on close readings of key Surrealist texts by Georges Bataille, Michel Leiris, and Roger Caillois. Even more important, however, are the prints''numerous references, heretofore unnoticed, to specific works by, among others, Rubens, Rembrandt, and Goya. These references effectively create an alternative"classical" tradition out of which Picasso''s etchings can be seen to haveemerged.', 'Art'),

In The Antiquity of Nepalese Wood Carving, Dr. Slusser drastically revises our perception of the marvelous wooden sculpture of the Kathmandu Valley.--Previously considered to be no earlier than the thirteenth century, the earliest of these wooden masterpieces have now been clearly demonstrated to date from the sixth or seventh century, the time of the Licchavis, lords of Nepal from about 300 to 850. Slusser has used an important scientific tool, radiocarbon dating, to help realign -- and correct -- our overly conservative accepted perceptions of the antiquity of Nepalese wood sculpture. The book is bolstered by the meticulous and painstaking research and documentation that are among the hallmarks of Slusser''s works. It is also enriched by her extraordinary photographic archive. Beautiful struts and architectural details that have long been missing from the sites where Slusser first saw them are shown once again in situ in this work, and new photographs, largely the work of Neil Greentree, reveal a wealth of previously unsuspected detail. Also included is an essay by Paul Jett that is both a brief explanation of the science of radiocarbon testing and a validation of the revised dating of Nepalese wood carving proposed in the study.--Mary Shepherd Slusser is the author of an authoritative history of the culture of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal Mandala. --Paul Jett is director of conservation and scientific research at the Freer/Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution.-', 'Art'),

Sound is usually understood as our second sense and - as our belief in a visually dominated culture prevails - remains of secondary interest.

This volume questions these assumptions by examining how sound differs from, and acts in relationship to, the visual. It moves beyond theoretical dichotomies (between the visual and the sonic, the oral and literature) and, instead, investigates sonic interventions in their often multi-faceted forms. The case studies deal with political appropriations of music and sounds, they explore the poetic use of the sonic in novels and plays, they develop theoretical concepts out of sonic phenomena, and pertain to identity formation and the practice of mixing in hip hop, opera and dancehall sessions. Ultimately, the book brings to the fore what roles sound may play for the formation of gendered identity, for the stabilization or questioning of race as a social category, and the conception of place. Their intricate interventions beckon critical attention and offer rich material for cultural analysis.', 'Art'),

He found his subjects wherever people gathered--at cafes, at the opera, in the public gardens. It was during the 1920s that he achieved the painting style for which he is best known. By the end of the 1940s, the artist, once part of a rebel art movement, had become part of the old guard, dismissing the rise of the New York School as incomprehensible and without lasting substance. Yet, he remains one of the most articulate interpreters of the tradition of urban realism. In this book Betsy Fahlman traces the life of the artist who, like his contemporary, Edward Hopper, did his early work under Robert Henri.

''But is it art?'' was a frequent cry during the mid-90s, when he exhibited the works of artists such as Damien Hirst, Marc Quinn, Gavin Turk and Marcus Harvey. Artists such as these soon fulfilled their promise and consolidated their reputations, vindicating Saatchi''s enthusiasm and their inclusion in this eclectic group. The book explores the ideas, aspirations and attitudes that inform each artist and the way that they are manifested in the end product. This publication, long out of print, remains an essential record of 35 artists that were collected by Charles Saatchi during the 1990s and is being reprinted to celebrate the opening of the new Saatchi Gallery later this year. <br>The book explores the ideas, aspirations and attitudes that inform each artist and the way that they are manifested in the end product. <br> This publication, long out of print, remains an essential record of 35 artists that were collected by Charles Saatchi during the 1990s and is being reprinted to celebrate the opening of the new Saatchi Gallery later this year. <br> ''Art today makes approaches towards the unknowable... artists reflect something both psychological and social off that gaze, something that may hint at the face the future will present. In this activity artist and critic are linked in an intimate collaboration. The artist makes unverifiable hypotheses or intuitive proposals about the unknown, and the critic drives out into the verbal open their networks of implications.'' Thomas McEvilley, ''Father the void'' in ''Tyne International: a new necessity'' 1990, p.133. <br>Thename of this book is derived from Damien Hirst''s extraordinary sculpture, ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, '' 1992, a fourteen-foot tiger shark suspended in a tank of formaldehyde. It is appropriate that Hirst should introduce this anthology, since he was responsible for making visible many of the artists included in these pages and, in many people''s minds, has come to epitomize the wild boy whose shock tactics and cool media manner give art a high profile and a bad name. His presence emphatically colours the 20water. <br>In 1988 while still a student at Goldsmiths'', Hirst organized ''Freeze, '' an exhibition that included sixteen of his fellow students. This marked the beginning of a vital period of optimism and enthusiasm. The recession provided a plentiful supply of empty factories, warehouses and offices and young artists seized the initiative, raised funds and mounted further shows such as ''Modern Medicine'' and ''Gambler'' in these dramatic spaces. <br>Charles Saatchi had been collecting their work and bought Hirst''s first major piece, ''A Thousand Years, '' with its rotting cow''s head and flies. Support of this kind is of incalculable value; it sustains energy and optimism. Whereas struggling in a vacuum is soul-destroying, the prospect of having one''s work enter a major collection provides both a goal and a context; it generates hope. Damien Hirst''s shark swam into view in the first show of Young British Artists mounted at the Saatchi Gallery in 1992 and attracted unprecedented media attention. <br>At first sight there seem to be few links between the thirty-five artists represented in this book. What possible preoccupations could be shared by aminimalist painter and a pickler of sharks? In writing about them, the author was determined not to impose artificial groupings. Despite their work being lumped together under the rubric of ''conceptualism, '' often by those hostile to it, these artists do not form a group or a school. Many of them studied at Goldsmiths'' and some are friends, but others have never met or even heard of one another. Kerry Stewart graduated only recently, Jenny Saville lives in Scotland, Carina Weidle has returned to Brazil and, although most of the others live in London, it is a big city. There is no cafe society or artists'' meeting place and these people do not form a cosy coterie.<br>', 'Art'),

From the Preface ... Francis D.K. Ching<br>The intriguing interplay among seeing, visualization, and expression through drawing is demonstrated in this book. Emphasizing the use of freehand drawing, it presents a series of examples, exercises and techniques that show how to quickly transfer images both seen and unseen into clear representational forms on paper.', 'Art'),

The jargon of post-modernity becomes easily understood through case STUDIES WHICH MAKE SENSE of cyberpunk fiction, music, film, TV, and contemporary architecture.'' --Rob Shields, Carleton University<br>Much of recent theory has characterized life in media-sophisticated societies in terms of a semiotic overload which, allegedly, has had only devastating effects on communication and subjectivity. <br> In "Architectures of Excess," Jim Collins argues that, while the rate of technological change has indeed accelerated, so has the rate of absorption. The seemingly endless array of information has generated not chaos but different structures and strategies, which harness that excess by turning it into forms of art and entertainment. Digital sampling in rap music and cyber-punk science fiction are well-known examples of techno-pop textuality, but Collins concentrates on other contemporaneous phenomena that are also envisioning new cultural landscapes by accessing that array--hyper-self-reflexivity in mall movies, best sellers, and prime-time television; the deconstructive vs. new-classical debate in architecture; the emergence of the "New Black Aesthetic; " the development of retro-modernism in interior design and the fashion industries. The analyses of these disparate, discontinous attempts to develop a meaningful sense of location, in an historical as well as a spatial sense, address a cluster of interconnected questions: How is the array of information being "domesticated?" How has appropriationism evolved from the Pop-Art of the sixties to the sampling of the nineties? How has the relationship between tradition, innovation, and evaluation been altered? "Architectures of Excess" investigates how these phenomena reflect change in taste and subjectivity, considering how we must account for both, pedagogically.', 'Art'),

Perhaps his best-known work is "20:50," currently on view at the Saatchi Gallery in London. A room is flooded with oil that has a highly reflective surface. Into the oil is built a kind of narrow pier down which one person can walk, the oil perilously close to their body. So reflective is the oil that the room induces a strong feeling of disorientation.

Working from a politicized concept of personal identity and a utopian vision of the future, the artist made a lasting impact on American art history and on the nation''s cultural heritage. Douglas''s role, as well as that of the Harlem Renaissance in general, in the evolution of American modernism deserves close scholarly attention, which it finally receives in this beautifully illustrated book. <p>Douglas combined angular Cubist rhythms and seductive Art Deco dynamism with traditional African and African American imagery. The result was a radically new utopian visual vocabulary that evoked both current realities and hopes for a better future. Presenting more than ninety illustrations of Douglas''s works and the commentary of leading critics and historians, this book focuses on the artist''s career from the 1920s through the 1940s in relation to American modernism. Its authors argue that Douglas''s bold work opened doors for African American artists in Harlem and beyond, and that it invited a dialogue with modernism that put African American life, labor, and freedom, along with African traditions and motifs, at its center. New information emerges from these pages, reflecting the rich interchange between the visual arts, music, dance, literature, and politics that shaped Douglas''s work and also defined the Harlem Renaissance.<br>', 'Art'),

Do we seek out aesthetic experiences simply because we enjoy them--or is there another, deeper, reason we spend our leisure time viewing or experiencing works of art? Aesthetics, the first short introduction to the<br>contemporary philosophy of aesthetics, examines not just the nature of the aesthetic experience, but the definition of art, and its moral and intrinsic value in our lives.<br> Anne Sheppard divides her work into two parts: In the first, she summarizes the major theories defining art and beauty; in the second, she explores the nature of aesthetic evaluation and appreciation. As Sheppard explains, there are three main approaches to defining art, all focused on what<br>art objects share. One proposes that all art imitates something in life, another that it expresses something (such as anger or ecstasy), still another suggests that all art has formal qualities.

Crunden begins with deft portraits of the figures who were central to the birth of Modernism, including James Whistler, the eccentric expatriate American painter who became the archetypal artist in his dress and behavior, and Henry and William James, who broke new ground in the genre of the novel and in psychology, influencing an international audience in a broad range of fields. At the heart of the book are the American salons - the intimate, personal gatherings of artists and intellectuals where Modernism flourished. In Chicago, Floyd Dell and Margery Currey spread new ideas to Sherwood Anderson, Theodore Dreiser, and others. In London, Ezra Pound could be found behind everything from the cigars of W. B. Yeats to the prose of Ford Madox Hueffer. In Paris, the salons of Leo and Gertrude Stein, and Michael and Sarah Stein, gave Picasso and Matisse their first secure audiences and incomes; meanwhile, Gertrude Stein produced a new writing style that had an incalculable impact on the generation of Ernest Hemingway. Most important of all were the salons of New York City. Alfred Stieglitz pioneered new forms of photography at the famous 291 Gallery. Mabel Dodge brought together modernist playwrights and painters, introducing them to political reformers and radicals. At the salon of Walter and Louise Arensberg, Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia rubbed shoulders with Wallace Stevens, Man Ray, and William Carlos Williams. By 1917, no art in America remained untouched by these new institutions. From the journalism of H. L. Mencken to the famous 1913Armory Show in New York, Crunden illuminates this pivotal era, offering perceptive insights and evocative descriptions of the central personalities of Modernism.', 'Art'),

Artistic developments of the period combined the influences of the symbolism and imagery of eastern Mediterranean art with the<br>explorations of humanity embodied in the narratives of Greek poetry, while drawings and sculptures referred so intimately to the human form as to lead both ancient and modern theorists to talk in terms of the ''mimetic'' role of art. Ranging widely over the fields of sculpture, vase painting, and the<br>minor arts, and offering a wide selection of unusual images alongside the familiar masterpieces, this work discusses the changing forms of art, and how art was used to define men''s relationships with other men, women, slaves, society, nature, and the gods.', 'Art'),

The authors also discuss how men and women of the Renaissance regarded art and artists, why works of Renaissance art look the way they do, and what this means to us. Unlike other books on the subject, this one covers not only Florence and Rome, but also Venice and the Veneto, Assisi, Siena, Milan, Pavia, Padua, Mantua, Verona, Ferrara, Urbino, and Naples-each governed in a distinctly different manner, every one with individual, political, and social structures that inevitably affected artistic styles. Spanning more than three centuries, the narrative brings to life the rich tapestry of Italian Renaissance society and the art that is its enduring legacy. Throughout, special features, including textual sources from the period and descriptions of social rituals, evoke and document the people and places of this dynamic age. The book covers the art and artists of Italy during the Renaissance-Florence, Rome, Milan, Venice, Naples and other regions, from the 13th through the 15th centuries.

This often leads exasperated viewers to exclaim--is this really art? <br> In this invaluable primer on aesthetics, Freeland explains why innovation and controversy are so highly valued in art, weaving together philosophy and art theory with many engrossing examples. Writing clearly and perceptively, she explores the cultural meanings of art in different contexts, <br>and highlights the continuities of tradition that stretch from modern, often sensational, works back to the ancient halls of the Parthenon, to the medieval cathedral of Chartres, and to African nkisi nkondi fetish statues. She explores the difficulties of interpretation, examines recent scientific<br>research into the ways the brain perceives art, and looks to the still-emerging worlds of art on the web, video art, art museum CD-ROMS, and much more. She also guides us through the various theorists of art, from Aristotle and Kant to Baudrillard. Throughout this nuanced account of theories, <br>artists, and works, Freeland provides us with a rich understanding of how cultural significance is captured in a physical medium, and why challenging our perceptions is, and always has been, central to the whole endeavor. <br> It is instructive to recall that Henri Matisse himself was originally derided as a "wild beast." To horrified critics, his bold colors and distorted forms were outrageous. A century later, what was once shocking is now considered beautiful. And that, writes Freeland, is art.', 'Art'),

How to order colors is not merely a philosophical question, it also has many practical<br>applications in art, design, and commerce. Our intense interest in color and its myriad practical applications have led people throughout history to develop many systems to characterize and order it. The number of color order systems developed throughout history is unknown but ranges in the<br>hundreds. Many are no longer used, but continue to be of historical interest. Despite wrong turns and slow progress, our understanding of color and its order has improved steadily. Although full understanding continues to elude us, it seems clear that it will ultimately come from research in<br>neurobiology, perception and consciousness. Color Ordered is a comprehensive, in-depth compendium of over 170 systems, dating from antiquity to the present. In it, Rolf Kuehni and Andreas Schwarz present a history and categorization of color systems, describe each one using original figures<br>and schematic drawings, and provide a broad review of the underlying theory.

In addition to the rise and fall of the two great art academies in Vienna and St. Petersburg, Howard examines the blending of migratory and sedentary cultures in the region, the role of women, and the political manipulation of the image. He brings to the<br>fore many overlooked artists and concentrates on neglected elements of work by better-known figures. Throughout, he reveals how the Habsburg, Romanov, and Ottoman empires vied with one another through art and howindividuals and nations strove to maintain and realize their voice through visual<br>language.<br> Bringing light to a woefully neglected subject, Howard has produced a work that will prove essential reading for lovers of art history and Eastern European culture.', 'Art'),

"Embroidery: Italian Fashion" follows the technique''s recent rise in a national culture known for its opulence and emotion, and brings readers the experience of both with a soft, embroidered cover. Inside, the details of micro-paillettes, mirrors, bugle beads, ribbons and implausibly thin threads produce virtuosities, coups de thibtre, surprising elegances. Embroidery is a door on a wondrous, opulent dimension where light plays with the richness of threads, and "Embroidery" shows its meaning transformed by the violence of modern lines and gestures, like the burnt Swarovski crystals that are Riccardo Tisci''s hallmark. When Antonio Marras presented a skirt at his first Milan show in which the embroidery seemed to allude to beginner''s work, to the gauze on which little girls once learned to sew, he asked his embroiderers to imitate this style, calling it "wrongstitch." And those extraordinary craftswomen, accustomed to perfection, learned just what feeling, what fascination can be concealed in an apparent mistake. The embroiderers and their colleagues remain the silent but ever-present heroines of this revival, their handiwork recalling the human touch at every glance. Includes work from Anna Molinari, Blumarine, Dolce & Gabbana, Emilio Pucci, Gianfranco Ferri, Marni, Roberto Cavalli, Valentino and Versace.', 'Art'),

Mahon explores eroticism from its most romantic to its most explicit: from<br>Impressionist Paris where the naked body signaled the rise of a new, modern world, to the contemporary scene where artists use eroticism to address the politics of race, gender, and sexual orientation. The book examines some of the key movements and moments in modern art history: from the birth of<br>Realism with Courbet in Paris, to the Surrealist subversion of taboo, to Nazi propaganda''s use of the heroic nude, to the soft-porn of Pop art, to the vogue for carnality in contemporary art in Los Angeles, Paris, and London. Indeed, Mahon provides a concise history of art in the twentieth century<br>through the lens of eroticism, offering original insights into works of art that do not sit easily within popular notions of taste and that have provoked controversy and calls for censorship. Her discussion includes the work of such European and American artists as Egon Schiele, Hans Bellmer, Robert<br>Mapplethorpe, Nancy Goldin, Orlan, Franco B, and Annie Sprinkle. <br> With over a hundred illustrations, including sixty-five in full color, here is a strikingly written and stimulating history of eroticism in modern Western art.', 'Art'),

Comics, a line of adventure, horror, and science-fiction comics whose influence on American graphic novels is undeniable, even today. Foul Play! is the perfect book for anyone wanting to understand the special place E.C. holds in the comic fan''s heart -- or who just wants to read some real good comics! <p> Foul Play! celebrates the fan-favorite creators of E.C. Comics, profiling their artists -- a veritable who''s who of mid-20th century popular illustration -- and describing how they came to work with Bill Gaines and how their careers evolved after E.C.. Among the comics art legends profiled are Al Feldstein; Harvey Kurtzman; Johnny Craig; Jack Davis; Graham Ingels; Jack Kamen; Wallace Wood; Joe Orlando; Will Elder; John Severin; George Evans; Al Williamson; Reed Crandall; Bernie Krigstein; and more! Plus, the book includes a special bonus: a lost E.C. Comics story "Wanted for Murder!" originally intended to be published in 1956 but forgotten and unseen until now. <p> When originally published, E.C. Comics titles like Tales from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror, and Weird Science became best-selling titles, embraced by readers for their macabre wit and stunning illustration. Eventually, E.C. Comics ran afoul of a full Senate Subcommittee investigating (but never proving!) the link between comic books and juvenile delinquency, but not before winning a legion of fans that still treasure E.C.''s output. Foul Play! demonstrates -- in glorious, gory detail -- exactly why these are among the most beloved comics storiesever published.', 'Art'),

The Glorious Revolution that followed forced James II to abdicate, and William and his wife, Mary, were jointly crowned king and queen on April 11, 1689. How was it that this almost bloodless coup took place with such apparent ease yet was not recognized as the full-blooded invasion and conquest it undoubtedly was? <p> In this wide-ranging book, Lisa Jardine assembles new research in political and social history, together with the histories of art, music, gardening, and science, to show how Dutch tolerance, resourcefulness, and commercial acumen had effectively conquered Britain long before William and his English wife arrived in London. "Going Dutch" is the remarkable story of the relationship between two of Europe''s most important colonial powers at the dawn of the modern age. <p> Throughout the seventeenth century, Holland and England were engaged in an energetic commercial and cultural exchange that survived three Anglo-Dutch wars. Dutch influence also permanently reshaped England''s cultural landscape. Whether through scientific discoveries, the design of royal palaces and gardens, or the introduction of works by the greatest painters of the age--Rubens, Rembrandt, and Van Dyck among them--the England we know today owes an extraordinary amount to its fierce competitor across the "narrow sea." <p> "Going Dutch" demonstrates how individuals, such as Christopher Wren, Isaac Newton, and successive generations of the remarkable Huygens family, who were usually represented as isolated geniuses working in the enclosed environment of their nativecountry in fact developed their ideas within a context of the easy Anglo-Dutch relations that laid the vital groundwork for the European Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution. <p> Above all, Lisa Jardine tests the traditional view that the rise of England as a world power took place at the expense of the Dutch. She finds that it was a "handing off" of the baton of cultural and intellectual supremacy to a Britain expanding in international power and influence. "Going Dutch" not only challenges conventional interpretations of England''s role in Enlightenment-era Europe but raises questions about the position in which post-empire Britain finds itself today.', 'Art'),

In an eloquent reflection of Paul Robeson, he shows how black art has reached across the boundaries of race to touch most of humanity.<br>Upon his arrival in the North, Frederick Douglass found, to his utter astonishment, "persons who could speak of the singing among slaves as the evidence of their contentment and happiness." As late as 1903, W.E.B. Du Bois observed that African American spirituals had led naive whites to<br>believe that "life was joyous to the black slave, careless and happy." While these misconceptions have largely disappeared, the history of African American culture--and its importance to American history as a whole--is still a subject little understood by the majority of Americans.<br> In Going Through the Storm, Sterling Stuckey offers a compelling look at one of the world''s richest cultural traditions. He traces the fertile legacy of African American art from its roots in tribal myth, through its blossoming in slave music and dance, to its fruition in the great<br>gospel-singing movements of the 1960s. In the process he shows how this tradition, grounded as it was in adversity, represents one of the great triumphs of the human spirit: slaves and their descendants, by way of Negro spirituals, the blues, and jazz, transformed the pain of oppression into a<br>transcendent and timeless beauty. And, as he explores these various styles, Stuckey reveals that the development of a distinctive African American aesthetic follows (and helps illuminate) the course of the nation''s history.<br> In a series of engaging, lucidly written essays, Going through the Storm covers the entire spectrum of African American culture, offering along the way many fresh and important insights. Within the context of slavery and slave music, Stuckey presents a new look at the foundations of black<br>nationalism and the civil rightsmovement. In his eloquent reflections on Paul Robeson, he shows how black art offers a commentary on the human spirit so genuine and resonant that its appeal has reached across the boundaries of race to touch most of humanity. Writing of Herman Melville, he<br>demonstrates how the great novelist was struck with the importance of African culture in history--and the reciprocal relationship of history to African culture--and carefully explored this theme in Benito Cereno. Frederick Douglass is presented for the first time as a major theorist of African<br>American culture, one whose thought is profoundly relevant to our current debates on culture and race. And, perhaps most important, Stuckey explains that because black artists have been deeply interested for so long in the question of oppression, their art is of particular use to historians. In<br>what amounts to nothing less than a revolutionary approach, Stuckey considers the uses of music as history, arguing that an easing of barriers between academic disciplines will lead to a better understanding of human life in general.<br> A timely, readable, and often moving volume, Going Through the Storm not only expands our understanding of black music, dance, literature, and folklore, but provides a new vantage point from which to view the entire landscape of American culture.', 'Art'),

In this work, which gathers previously uncollected<br>essays and a series of seminars delivered at Bennington College in 1971, Greenberg provides his most expansive statement of his views on taste and quality in art. He insists that despite the attempts of modern artists to escape the jurisdiction of taste by producing an art so disjunctive that it<br>cannot be judged, taste is inexorable. He maintains that standards of quality in art, ohe artist''s responsibility to seek out the hardest demands of a medium, and the critic''s responsibility to discriminate, are essential conditions for great art. He discusses the interplay of expectation and<br>surprise in aesthetic experience, and the exalted consciousness produced by great art. Homemade Esthetics allows us to watch the critic''s mind at work, defending (and at times reconsidering) his controversial and influential theories. Charles Harrison''s introduction to this volume places Homemade<br>Esthetics in the context of Greenberg''s work and the evolution of 20th century criticism.', 'Art'),

Throughout Europe and America, artists and intellectuals banded together to portray women as static and unindividuated beings who<br>functioned solely in a sexual and reproductive capacity, thus formulating many of the anti-feminine platitudes that today still constrain women''s potential.<br> Bram Dijkstra''s Idols of Perversity explores the nature and development of turn-of-the-century misogyny in the works of hundreds of writers, artists, and scientists, including Zola, Strindberg, Wedekind, Henry James, Rossetti, Renoir, Moreau, Klimt, Darwin, and Spencer. Dijkstra demonstrates<br>that the most prejudicial aspects of Evolutionary Theory helped to justify this wave of anti-feminine sentiment. The theory claimed that the female of the species could not participate in the great evolutionary process that would guide the intellectual male to his ultimate, predestined role as a<br>disembodied spiritual essence. Darwinists argued that women hindered this process by their willingness to lure men back to a sham paradise of erotic materialism. To protect the male''s continued evolution, artists and intellectuals produced a flood of pseudo-scientific tracts, novels, and paintings<br>which warned the world''s males of the evils lying beneath the surface elegance of woman''s tempting skin.<br> Reproducing hundreds of pictures from the period and including in-depth discussions of such key works as Dracula and Venus in Furs, this fascinating book not only exposes the crucial links between misogyny then and now, but also connects it to the racism andanti-semitism that led to<br>catastrophic genocidal delusions in the first half of the twentieth century. Crossing the conventional boundaries of art history, sociology, the history of scientific theory, and literary analysis, Dijkstra unveils a startling view of a grim and largely one-sided war on women still being fought<br>today.', 'Art'),

The first part of the book traces the history of the two organized notions of aesthetics-the theory of beauty<br>and the imitation theory of art-and describes the transformations they went through from ancient Greek times until the 1950s. The responses of the cultural theories in the 1960s to these earlier developments are then discussed in detail. Four additional topics-intentionalistic criticism, symbolism, <br>metaphor, and expression-are also addressed. Finally, five traditional art evaluational theories are presented, and the author constructs an evaluational theory of his own by building on ideas drawn from the work of Monroe Beardsley and Nelson Goodman. <br> Written by one of the foremost philosophers of aesthetics, Introduction to Aesthetics is ideal for undergraduate courses in the philosophy of art and aesthetics, and is also suitable for graduate seminars and courses in these areas. It offers students both a historical introduction to and the<br>latest work on theories of art, theories of the experience of art, and theories of art evaluation.', 'Art'),

As Nadia, a high-powered interior designer says, "My cell and my big Tod''s purse -- that is my life."<p> In IT''S IN THE BAG, noted journalist Winifred Gallagher explains it what means for a purse to be a life.

Behind their imposing facades and highly decorated churches, the convents of Naples housed the daughters of the city''s most exclusive families, women who, despite their cloistered existence, were formidable players in<br>the city''s power structure. Invisible City vividly portrays the religious world of seventeenth-century Naples, a city of familial and internecine rivalries, of religious devotion and intense urban politics, of towering structures built to house the virgin daughters of the aristocracy. Helen Hills<br>demonstrates how the architecture of the convents and the nuns'' bodies they housed existed both in parallel and in opposition to one another. She discusses these women as subjects of enclosure, as religious women, and as art patrons, but also as powerful agents whose influence extended beyond the<br>convent walls. Though often ensconced in convents owing to their families'' economic circumstances, many of these young women were able to extend their influence as a result of the role convents played both in urban life and in art patronage. The convents were rich and powerful organizations, riven<br>with feuds and prey to the ambitions of viceregal and elite groups, which their thick walls could not exclude. Even today, Neapolitan convents figure prominently in the city''s fabric. In analyzing the architecture of these august institutions, Helen Hills skillfully reads conventual architecture as<br>a metaphor for the body of the aristocratic virgin nun, mapping out the dialectic between flesh and stone.', 'Art'),

The composer plays constantly with musical genres and styles, moving between them without warning in a way that often bewildered his contemporaries. Ranging freely across Mahler''s symphonies and songs in a thoughtful and thorough study of his musical speech, Julian Johnson considers how this body of music foregrounds the idea of artifice, construction and musical convention while at the same time presenting itself as act of authentic expression and disclosure. Mahler''s Voices explores the shaping of this music through strategies of calling forth its own mysterious voice--as if from nature or the Unconscious--while at other times revealing itself as a made object, often self-consciously assembled from familiar and well-worn materials. <br> A unique study not of Mahler''s works as such but of Mahler''s musical style, Mahler''s Voices brings together a close reading of the renowned composer''s music with wide-ranging cultural and historical interpretation. Through a radical self-awareness that links the romantic irony of the late 18th-century to the deconstructive attitude of the late 20th-century, Mahler''s music forces us to rethink historical categories themselves. Yet what sets it apart, what continues to fascinate and disturb, is the music''s ultimate refusal of this position, acknowledging the conventionality of all its voices while at the same time, in the intensity of its tone, speaking "as if" what it said were true. However bound up with the Viennese modernism that Mahler prefigured, the urgency of this act remains powerfully resonant for our own age.', 'Art'),

Early paper decoration techniques were also developed in both China and Japan. The marbling technique was known In these two countries as early as the 12th century AD. During the 16th century, it was popular in Persia and Turkey, and from there, knowledge of marbling spread to western Europe. In the 17th-19th centuries, there was substantial marbled paper production in Germany, France, Italy, Holland and England. For paper marbling, a large receptacle is filled with a gelatinous substance, and drops of watercolour dye are floated on top. The colour is then spread with a brush, comb or other tool to produce the desired effect. A sheet of paper is then placed on the floating dye, leaving a mirror image of the design on the paper. Common styles include comb marbling, ''French curl'' marbling and stone marbling; examples of these and other styles can all be found in Marbled Paper Design. A variation on marbled paper is paste paper. In this technique, a layer of starch is applied to blank paper, and paint is added on top of it. The design is produced by manipulating the paint with a brush or scraper, or with the help of stamps or rollers. Japanese Papers includes an extensive and rare selection of such designs. This book also contains stunning examples of other Japanese paper decoration techniques, such as block printing and the application of design during the actual paper-making process.', 'Art'),

"Transparent Pictures,"''Walton''s classic and controversial account of what is special about photographic<br>pictures, is included, along with a new essay on a curious but rarely noticed feature of photographs and other still pictures-the fact that a depiction of a momentary state of an object in motion allows viewers to observe that state, in imagination, for an extended period of time. Two older essays<br>round out the collection-another classic, "Categories of Art," and a less well known essay, "Style and the Products and Processes of Art," which examines the role of appreciators'' impressions of how a work of art came about, in understanding and appreciation. None of the reprinted essays is<br>abridged, and new postscripts have been added to several of them.', 'Art'),

He then examines the revolutionary upheaval that swept Germany between 1789 and 1815, arguing that the first great German museums reflected the nation''s revolutionary aspirations. By the mid-nineteenth century, the climate had changed; museums constructed in this period affirmed historical continuities and celebrated political accomplishments. During the next several years, however, Germans became disillusioned with conventional definitions of art and lost interest in monumental museums. By the turn of the century, the museum had become a site for the political and cultural controversies caused by the rise of artistic modernism.

The text is organized geographically and draws upon the testimonies of oral tradition, Native American history, and the latest research in North American archaeology.Recent art historical scholarship has helped restore, to a large degree, some understanding of the identities and cultural roles of Native American artists and the social contexts of the objects they created. Native American art is often discussed simply as a cultural production rather than the work of individual artists who made objects to fufill social and cultural purposes; this book focuses as much as possible on the artists themselves, their cultural identities, and the objects they made even when the names of the individual artists remain unrecoverable.But this is not a book of artists'' biographies. It seeks to inform a general readership about the history of Native American art with a lively narrative full of historical incident and illustrated with provocative and superlative works of art. It explores the tension between artistic continuities spanning thousands of years and the startlingly fresh innovations that resulted from specific historical circumstances. The narrative weaves together so-called "traditional" arts, "tourist" arts, and Native American art of today by taking the point of view of their particular and local histories the artists, their communities, and audiences.Among the many cultures included are: Arapaho, Athapascan, Cherokee, Cheyenne, Chumash, Hopi, Hupa/Karok, Inuit, Iroquois, Kwakiutl, Lakota, Miwok, Navajo, Ojibwa, Pomo, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Uypik, and Zuni.&nbsp;', 'Art'),

The period also witnessed a violent conflict in Asia Minor between warring peoples in the region, a conflict commonly believed to be the historical basis for Homer''s Trojan War.

Each of the periods are further subdivided geographically, so that individual articles are concerned with Mainland Greece during the Early Bronze Age, Crete during the Early Bronze Age, the Cycladic Islands during the Early Bronze Age, and the same for the Middle Bronze Age, followed by the Late Bronze Age.

Here is a religion shaped by a rigid authoritarian hierarchy and radical<br>individualism; by prophetic certainty and a celebration of learning and intellectual investigation; by existence in exile and a yearning for integration and acceptance by the larger world. Givens divides Mormon history into two periods, separated by the renunciation of polygamy in 1890. In each, he<br>explores the life of the mind, the emphasis on education, the importance of architecture and urban planning (so apparent in Salt Lake City and Mormon temples around the world), and Mormon accomplishments in music and dance, theater, film, literature, and the visual arts. He situates such cultural<br>practices in the context of the society of the larger nation and, in more recent years, the world. Today, he observes, only fourteen percent of Mormon believers live in the United States. <br>Mormonism has never been more prominent in public life.

The images are analyzed in relation to a range of cultural and representational issues (desire, power, the gaze, bodies, sexuality, ethnicity) and methodologies (semiotics, <br>marxism, psychoanalysis, feminism, postcolonial theory). Central topics such as ideology, the concept of the spectator, the role of reproduction in visual culture, the mass media and the public sphere, consumer culture, and postmodernism are explained in depth. <br> In this second edition, Sturken and Cartwright include new information on the concept of nationalism and security since 9/ll, the explosion of new media technologies, and the impact of globalization on information flows and media form andcontent.

The winners in warfare routinely seized for themselves the artistic and cultural treasures of the defeated; plunder constituted a marker of triumph. By the twentieth century, international norms declared the<br>opposite, that cultural monuments should be shielded from destruction or seizure. Prohibiting Plunder traces and explains the emergence of international rules against wartime looting of cultural treasures, and explores how anti-plunder norms have developed over the past 200 years. The book covers<br>highly topical events including the looting of thousands of antiquities from the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad, and the return of "Holocaust Art" by prominent museums, including the highly publicized return of five Klimt paintings from the Austrian Gallery to a Holocaust survivor. <br> The historical narrative includes first-hand reports, official documents, and archival records. Equally important, the book uncovers the debates and negotiations that produced increasingly clear and well-defined anti-plunder norms. The historical accounts in Prohibiting Plunder serve as confirming<br>examples of an important dynamic of international norm change. Rules evolve in cycles; in each cycle, specific actions trigger arguments about the meaning and application of rules, and those arguments in turn modify the rules. International norms evolve through a succession of such cycles, each one<br>drawing on previous developments and each one reshaping the normative context for subsequent actions and disputes. Prohibiting Plunder shows how historical episodes interlinked to produce modern, treaty-based rules againstwartime plunder of cultural treasures.', 'Art'),

"Remembering the Present is a major step forward in both the presentation of cultural materials and in their analysis."--Clifford Geertz<br>This book combines ethnography with the study of art to present a fascinating new vision of African history. It contains the paintings of a single artist depicting Zaire''s history, along with a series of ethnographic essays discussing local history, its complex relationship to forms of self-expression and self-understanding, and the aesthetics of contemporary urban African and Third World societies. As a collaboration between ethnographer and painter, this innovative study challenges text-oriented approaches to understanding history and argues instead for an event- and experience-oriented model, ultimately adding a fresh perspective to the discourse on the relationship between modernity and tradition.<br>During the 1970s, Johannes Fabian encouraged Tshibumba Kanda Matulu to paint the history of Zaire. The artist delivered the work in batches, together with an oral narrative. Fabian recorded these statements along with his own question-and-answer sessions with the painter. The first part of the book is the complete series of 100 paintings, with excerpts from the artist''s narrative and the artist-anthropologist dialogues. Part Two consists of Fabian''s essays about this and other popular painting in Zaire. The essays discuss such topics as performance, orality, history, colonization, and popular art.', 'Art'),

Various interpretations of this seeming paradox have been advanced. Some suggest that it represents sacrifice to a higher deity. Proponents<br>of anthropomorphic projection say that the gods are just "big people" and that images of human religious action are simply projected onto the deities. However, such explanations do not do justice to the complexity and diversity of this phenomenon. <br>In Religion of the Gods, Kimberley C. Patton uses a comparative approach to take up anew a longstanding challenge in ancient Greek religious iconography: why are the Olympian gods depicted on classical pottery making libations? The sacrificing gods in ancient Greece are compared to gods who perform<br>rituals in six other religious traditions: the Vedic gods, the heterodox god Zurvan of early Zoroastrianism, the Old Norse god Odin, the Christian God and Christ, the God of Judaism, and Islam''s Allah. Patton examines the comparative evidence from a cultural and historical perspective, uncovering<br>deep structural resonances while also revealing crucial differences. <br>Instead of looking for invisible recipients or lost myths, Patton proposes the new category of "divine reflexivity." Divinely performed ritual is a self-reflexive, self-expressive action that signals the origin of ritual in the divine and not the human realm. Above all, divine ritual is generative, <br>both instigating and inspiring human religious activity. The religion practiced by the gods is both like and unlike human religious action. Seen from within the religious tradition, gods are not "big people," but other than human. Human ritual is directed outward to a divine being, but the gods<br>practice ritual on their own behalf. "Cultic time," the symbiotic performance of ritual both in heaven and on earth, collapses the distinction between cult and theology each time ritual is performed. Offering the first comprehensive study and a new theory of this fascinating phenomenon, Religion of<br>the Gods is a significant contribution to the fields of classics and comparative religion. Patton shows that the god who performs religious action is not an anomaly, but holds a meaningful place in the category of ritual and points to a phenomenologically universal structure within religion itself.<br>', 'Art'),

A broad group of intellectuals and artists in Soviet Russia were able to take advantage of this, and in no realm of the arts was this perhaps more true than in music. Students at Soviet conservatories were at last able to use various channels--many of questionable legality--to acquire and hear music that had previously been forbidden, and visiting performers and composers brought young Soviets new sounds and new compositions. In the 1960s, composers such as Andrey Volkonsky, Edison Denisov, Alfred Schnittke, Arvo Part, Sofia Gubaidulina, and Valentin Silvestrov experimented with a wide variety of then new and unfamiliar techniques ranging from serialism to aleatory devices, and audiences eager to escape the music of predictable sameness typical to socialist realism were attracted to performances of their new and unfamiliar creations. <br> This "unofficial" music by young Soviet composers inhabited the gray space between legal and illegal. Such Freedom, If Only Musical traces the changing compositional styles and politically charged reception of this music, and brings to life the paradoxical freedoms and sense of resistance or opposition that it suggested to Soviet listeners. Author Peter J. Schmelz draws upon interviews conducted with many of the most important composers and performers of the musical Thaw, and supplements this first-hand testimony with careful archival research and detailed musical analyses. The first book to explore this period in detail, Such Freedom, If Only Musical will appeal to musicologists and theorists interested in post-war arts movements, the Cold War, and Soviet music, as well as historians of Russian culture and society.', 'Art'),

Linus, who had just learned to speak in the previous volume, becomes downright eloquent and even begins to fend off Lucy''s bullying; even so, his security neurosis becomes more pronounced, including a harrowing two-week "Lost Weekend" sequence of blanketlessness. Charlie Brown cascades further down the hill to loserdom, with spectacularly lost kites, humiliating baseball losses (including one where he becomes "the Goat" and is driven from the field in a chorus of BAAAAHs); at least his newly acquired "pencil pal" affords him some comfort.

A scholar in the tradition of the great Indian grammarians and philosophers, an art historian convinced that the ultimate value of art transcends history, and a social thinker influenced by William Morris, Coomaraswamy was a unique figure whose works provide virtually a complete education in themselves. Finding a universal tradition in past cultures ranging from the Hellenic and Christian to the Indian, Islamic, and Chinese, he collated his ideas and symbols of ancient wisdom into the sometimes complex, always rewarding pattern of essays. "The Door in the Sky" is a collection of the author''s writings on myth drawn from his "Metaphysics" and "Traditional Art and Symbolism," both originally published in Bollingen Series. These essays were written while Coomaraswamy was curator in the department of Asiatic Art of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, where he built the first large collection of Indian art in the United States.', 'Art'),

Is it "real" or "original" is a way of asking what am I buying? What do I own? What am I looking at? And today more sophisticated questions are being asked: How is<br>authenticity determined and what weight does this determination have in court? This book of essays proposes to answer those questions. <br>Three lines of inquiry are basic to determining authenticity: a connoisseur''s evaluation, historical documentation or provenance, and scientific testing. A connoisseur is an expert who evaluates the "rightness" of a work based on much careful scrutiny of many works by an artist and familiarity with<br>that artist''s usual manner of working with materials. In determining provenance, a researcher traces the physical object from the artist through a chain of ownership to the present owner--simple enough in concept, though it assumes that the documentation is not faked or inaccurate. The goal is to<br>ensure that the object is the same one that left the artist''s hand. Scientific testing, although sometimes useful, is often longer on promise than result. Dating paint or wood samples, for instance, can show that a painting was made in Rembrandt''s lifetime, but it cannot prove that it is by<br>Rembrandt''s hand. If expert opinion is divided, and large sums of money are involved, a dispute over authenticity may end up in a court of law, where evaluation of expert opinion evidence can be problematic. <br>The essays in this book clarify the nature of the methods outlined above and explain, based on case law, the present status of authentication issues in court. Contributorsinclude experts from Christie''s, London; Sotheby''s, New York; and the former director of the Frick Collection; as well as<br>leading art historians and art dealers; an art conservator; a forensic graphologist; a philanthropist and collector; and a specialist in French art law.

Yet by the end of World War II, almost the only thing remaining of their vast empire was a collection of 264 wood and ivory carvings, none of them larger than a matchbox. <br>The renowned ceramicist Edmund de Waal became the fifth generation to inherit this small and exquisite collection of netsuke. Entranced by their beauty and mystery, he determined to trace the story of his family through the story of the collection. <br>The netsuke--drunken monks, almost-ripe plums, snarling tigers--were gathered by Charles Ephrussi at the height of the Parisian rage for all things Japanese. Charles had shunned the place set aside for him in the family business to make a study of art, and of beautiful living. An early supporter of the Impressionists, he appears, oddly formal in a top hat, in Renoir''s "Luncheon of"" the Boating Party." Marcel Proust studied Charles closely enough to use him as a model for the aesthete and lover Swann in "Remembrance of Things Past." <br>Charles gave the carvings as a wedding gift to his cousin Viktor in Vienna; his children were allowed to play with one netsuke each while they watched their mother, the Baroness Emmy, dress for ball after ball. Her older daughter grew up to disdain fashionable society. Longing to write, she struck up a correspondence with Rilke, who encouraged her in her poetry. <br>The Anschluss changed their world beyond recognition. Ephrussi and his cosmopolitan family were imprisoned or scattered, and Hitler''s theorist on the "Jewish question" appropriated their magnificent palace on the Ringstrasse. A library of priceless books and a collection of Old Master paintings were confiscated by the Nazis. But the netsuke were smuggled away by a loyal maid, Anna, and hidden in her straw mattress. Years after the war, she would find a way to return them to the family she''d served even in their exile. <br>In "The Hare with Amber Eyes," Edmund de Waal unfolds the story of a remarkable family and a tumultuous century. Sweeping yet intimate, it is a highly original meditation on art, history, and family, as elegant and precise as the netsuke themselves.', 'Art'),

"Style is like a feather in a woman''s hat, nothing more," said Le Corbusier, expressing most modern architects'' low regard for the subject. But Witold Rybczynski disagrees, and in The Look of Architecture, he makes a compelling case for the importance of style to<br>the mother of the arts.<br> This is a book brimming with sharp observations--that form does not follow function; that the best architecture is not timeless but precisely of its time; that details do not merely complement the architecture--details are the architecture. But the heart of the book illuminates the connection<br>between architecture, interior decoration, and fashion. Style is the language of architecture, Rybczynski writes, and fashion represents the wide and swirling cultural currents that shape and direct that language. The two--style and fashion--are intimately linked; indeed, architecture cannot escape<br>fashion. To set these ideas in sharp relief, he shows us how style and fashion have been expressed in the work of major architects including Frank Gehry, Mies van der Rohe, Charles McKim, Allan Greenberg, Robert Venturi, Enrique Norten, and many others. He helps us see their works anew and<br>ultimately to look afresh at our surroundings.<br> Style is one of the enduring--and endearing--aspects of architecture, Rybczynski concludes.

The fascinating details of the artist Caravaggio''s strange, turbulent career and the astonishing beauty of his work come to life in these pages.<br>An Italian village on a hilltop near the Adriatic coast, a decaying palazzo facing the sea, and in the basement, cobwebbed and dusty, lit by a single bulb, an archive unknown to scholars. Here, a young graduate student from Rome, Francesca Cappelletti, makes a discovery that inspires a search for a work of art of incalculable value, a painting lost for almost two centuries. <br>The artist was Caravaggio, a master of the Italian Baroque. He was a genius, a revolutionary painter, and a man beset by personal demons. Four hundred years ago, he drank and brawled in the taverns and streets of Rome, moving from one rooming house to another, constantly in and out of jail, all the while painting works of transcendent emotional and visual power. He rose from obscurity to fame and wealth, but success didn''t alter his violent temperament. His rage finally led him to commit murder, forcing him to flee Rome a hunted man. He died young, alone, and under strange circumstances. <br>Caravaggio scholars estimate that between sixty and eighty of his works are in existence today. Many others-no one knows the precise number-have been lost to time. Somewhere, surely, a masterpiece lies forgotten in a storeroom, or in a small parish church, or hanging above a fireplace, mistaken for a mere copy. <br>Prizewinning author Jonathan Harr embarks on an spellbinding journey to discover the long-lost painting known as The Taking of Christ-its mysterious fate and the circumstances of its disappearance have captivated Caravaggio devotees for years. After Francesca Cappelletti stumbles across a clue in that dusty archive, she tracks the painting across a continent and hundreds of years of history. But it is not until shemeets Sergio Benedetti, an art restorer working in Ireland, that she finally manages to assemble all the pieces of the puzzle. <br>Told with consummate skill by the writer of the bestselling, award-winning "A Civil Action," The Lost Painting is a remarkable synthesis of history and detective story.

Harr''s account is not unlike a Caravaggio painting: vivid, deftly wrought, and enthralling.<br>." . . Jonathan Harr has gone to the trouble of writing what will probably be a bestseller . . . rich and wonderful. . .in truth, the book reads better than a thriller because, unlike a lot of best-selling nonfiction authors who write in a more or less novelistic vein (Harr''s previous book, "A Civil Action," was made into a John Travolta movie), Harr doesn''t plump up hi tale. He almost never foreshadows, doesn''t implausibly reconstruct entire conversations and rarely throws in litanies of clearly conjectured or imagined details just for color''s sake. . .if you''re a sucker for Rome, and for dusk. . . you''ll] enjoy Harr''s more clearly reported details about life in the city, as when--one of my favorite moments in the whole book--Francesca and another young colleague try to calm their nerves before a crucial meeting with a forbidding professor by eating gelato. And who wouldn''t in Italy? The pleasures of travelogue here are incidental but not inconsiderable." --"The New York Times Book Review" <p>"Jonathan Harr has taken the story of the lost painting, and woven from it a deeply moving narrative about history, art and taste--and about the greed, envy, covetousness andprofessional jealousy of people who fall prey to obsession.

This global<br>approach offers revealing new insights into such men as Dante and Leonardo da Vinci and highlights the international influences behind Chaucer''s Canterbury Tales. Along with fresh and original discussions of well-known figures from Copernicus to Durer to Shakespeare, Brotton offers a far-reaching<br>exploration that looks at paintings and technology, patterns of trade and the printed page, as he illuminates the overarching themes that defined the age.<br> From architecture to medicine, from humorists to explorers, the teeming world of the Renaissance comes to life in this thoughtful, insightful, and beautifully written book, which offers us a timely perspective on the Renaissance as a moment of global inclusiveness that still has much to teach<br>us today.', 'Art'),

For the &#64257;rst time, this volume gathers all that he produced during these last few months and presents it in a day-by-day chronology that reveals his intense focus on the continuing development of his signature artistic method as well as his innermost thoughts and concerns. <br>Persuaded by his doting brother, Theo, to move to the artistic enclave of Auvers-sur-Oise in 1890 for a change of scenery and a chance at a life free from temptation, and with the intent of concentrating solely on painting and restoring his full mental health, van Gogh arrived in May just as the town and its nearby bucolic &#64257;elds were bursting into full springtime glory, providing him ample material for inspiration. Stunning reproductions of his last paintings display his daily explorations of this charming hamlet&rsquo;s streets and buildings, including its now-iconic church and thatched cottages, its inhabitants&mdash;including his friend and mentor Doctor Gachet, immortalized on canvas&mdash;and the wide, open &#64257;elds that roused him to paint masterpieces such as "Wheat Field with Crows" and "Landscape with a Carriage and a Train." Despite these idyllic surroundings, his encouraging pace of production, and mounting critical recognition, van Gogh chose to end his own life a mere two and a half months later, leaving the letters and paintings duplicated here as the only clues to the internal anguish that led him to an act of such desperation. <br>The full complexity of van Gogh&rsquo;s personality, emotions, and relationships is presented here through reproductions of historical documents, letters, and glorious full-color plates of over seventy paintings, each of which is also accompanied by incisive commentary from author Wouter van der Veen, a renowned van Gogh scholar.

In Art and Embodiment he develops this theme in much greater depth, arguing that art can bridge the gap between philosophy''s traditional striving for generality<br>and completeness, and the concreteness and contingency of humanity''s basic relation to the world. As the key element in his theory, he proposes an ecological definition of art. His strategy involves first mapping out and analyzing the logical boundaries and ontological structures of the aesthetic<br>domain. He then considers key concepts from this analysis in the light of a tradition in Continental philosophy (notably the work of Kant, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Hegel) which--by virtue of the philosophical significance that it assigns to art--significantly anticipates the ecological<br>conception. On this basis, Crowther is able to give a full formulation of his ecological definition. Art, in making sensible or imaginative material into symbolic form, harmonizes and conserves what is unique and what is general in human experience. The aesthetic domain answers basic needs intrinsic<br>to self-consciousness itself, and art is the highest realization of such needs. In the creation and reception of art the embodied subject is fully at home with his or her environment.', 'Art'),

What drives us to make art? Why do we value art and consume it? Nick Zangwill argues that we cannot understand the nature of art without first having answers to these fundamental questions. On his view, which he dubs "the Aesthetic Creation Theory," a work<br>of art is something created for a particular aesthetic purpose. More specifically, the function of art is to have certain aesthetic properties in virtue of its non-aesthetic properties, and this function arises because of the artist''s insight into the nature of these dependence relations and her<br>intention to bring them about. In defending this view, Zangwill provides an account of aesthetic action and aesthetic creative thought and shows how the Aesthetic Creation Theory can accommodate two kinds of seeming counterexamples to aesthetic theories of art: narrative art and twentieth-century<br>avant-garde art. Aesthetic Creation also contains a detailed exposition and critique of a range of rival views, including Dickie''s institutional theory of art, accounts of art that make essential reference to an audience, and sociological theories which purport to explain the nature of art without<br>recourse to the notion of the aesthetic.', 'Art'),

The long perspective allows the vicissi-tudes of successive institutions of county government to be examined thoroughly. For example, the rise of the justices of the peace is fully chronicled from their in-conspicuous origins under Edward I to the amplitude of their powers and duties in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Shropshire''s medieval government had a number of peculiarities, caused by the county''s fron-tier position opposite the hostile Welsh. Accordingly its ''palatine'' earldom, its serjeants of the peace, its loss of territory to marcher lordships, and its subjection to the Council in the Marches of Wales receive special attention. From Elizabeth I''s reign, as the magistrates'' concerns increased, the story comes to include much of the social history of the times. From 1889, when the county council was formed, that history has been one of unprecedented penetration by local government into formerly untouched areas of local and personal affairs. The institutions of Shropshire''s govern-ment provided opportunities for influence and advancement; the volume thus em-bodies a history of the fortunes of Shrop-shire''s leading men and families. Most prominent in the Middle Ages were the earls of Shrewsbury, Arundel, and March. Since then the families of Corbet, Newport, Herbert, Clive, and Bridgeman have been among the weightiest. Linked with their fortunes were those of smaller landowners and local officials. In the 18th century, with the appointments of its first permanent county treasurer and of its first county surveyor, Thomas Telford, Shropshire took a large step towards the formation of a modern county bureaucracy. Nowhere has the play of ambition and manouvre been more openly exercised than in elections to Parliament. The volume explores the intricacies of Shrop-shire electioneering from Edward I''s reign to the general election of October 1974, and illustrates the manner in which conflicting electoral interests bit deep into the sub-stance of Shropshire society.', 'Art'),

The brands and firms which have shaped this industry, such as Avon, Coty, EstA(c)e Lauder, L''OrA(c)al, and Shiseido, have imagined beauty for us. <br>This book provides the first authoritative history of the global beauty industry from its emergence in the nineteenth century to the present day, exploring how today''s global giants grew. It shows how successive generations of entrepreneurs built brands which shaped perceptions of beauty, and the business organizations needed to market them. They democratized access to beauty products, once the privilege of elites, but they also defined the gender and ethnic borders of beauty, and its association with a handful of cities, notably Paris and later New York. The result was a homogenization of beauty ideals throughout the world. <br>Today globalization is changing the beauty industry again; its impact can be seen in a range of competing strategies.

Breaking away from the language and style of Dickens and the static panorama paintings of William<br>Powell Frith, major figures such as Henry James and J. M. Whistler, and, crucially, less-celebrated authors such as Arthur Machen, Edwin Pugh, and George Egerton bent realism into exciting new shapes. In the naturalism of George Gissing and Arthur Morrison, the fragmentary impressions of Ford Madox<br>Ford, and the brooding mystery of Alvin Langdon Coburn''s photogravures, London emerged as a focus for dynamic, explicitly modern art. Although many of these insights would be dismissed or at least downplayed by subsequent generations, the ideas evolved during the period from 1870 to 1914 anticipate<br>not only the work of high modernists such as Eliot and Woolf, but also that of later urban theorists such as Foucault and de Certeau, and the novels and travelogues of contemporary London writers Peter Ackroyd and Iain Sinclair. Nicholas Freeman recovers a sense of late-Victorian London as a subject<br>for dynamic theoretical and aesthetic experiments, and shows, in stimulating analyses of Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, Arthur Symons, and others how much of our understanding of urban space we owe to eminent (and not so eminent) Victorian figures. Written in a clear and accessible style, the book<br>restores a much-needed historical perspective to our engagement with the metropolis.', 'Art'),

They then consider the relationship to Functional Beauty of certain views in current aesthetic thought, especially what we call ''cognitively rich'' approaches to the aesthetic appreciation of both art and nature. Turning to work on the nature of function in the philosophy of science, they argue that this line of enquiry can help solve certain philosophical problems that have been raised for the idea that knowledge of function plays an important role in aesthetic appreciation. <br> Although philosophical discussions of aesthetic appreciation tend to focus largely and sometimes almost exclusively on artworks, the range of aesthetic appreciation is, of course, much larger. Not simply art, but also nature, architecture, and even more mundane, everyday things--cars, tools, clothing, furniture, and sports--are objects of frequent and enthusiastic aesthetic appreciation. Accordingly, in the second half of the book, Glen Parsons and Allen Carlson consider the place and importance of Functional Beauty in the aesthetic appreciation of a broad range of different kinds of things. The final chapters explore Functional Beauty in nature and the natural environment, in architecture and the built environment, in everyday artifacts, events, and activities, and finally in art and the artworld. In each case, Parsons and Carlson argue that Functional Beauty illuminates our aesthetic experiences and helps to address various theoretical issues raised by these different objects of appreciation.', 'Art'),

Its supporters saw themselves as a new elite, ideally placed to tackle the many challenges facing the young and rapidly industrializing German nation-state. They defined themselves as bourgeois, and acted as self-appointed champions of a modern consciousness. Focusing on figures such as Hermann Muthesius, Fritz Schumacher, and Karl-Ernst Osthaus, and the activities of the Deutscher Werkbund and other networks of bourgeois designers, writers, and ''experts'', this book shows how bourgeois modernism shaped the infrastructure of social and political life in early twentieth-century Germany. <br> Bourgeois modernism exercised its power not so much in the realm of ideas, but by transforming the physical environment of German cities, from domestic interiors, via consumer objects, to urban and regional planning. Drawing on a detailed analysis of key material sites of bourgeois modernism, and interpreting them in conjunction with written sources, this study offers new insights into the history of the bourgeois mindset and its operations in the private and public realms. Thematic chapters examine leitmotifs such as the sense of locality and place, the sense of history and time, and the sense of nature and culture. Yet for all its self-conscious progressivism, German bourgeois modernism was not an inevitable precursor of neo-liberal global capitalism. It remained a hotly contested historical construct, which was constantly re-defined in different geographical and political settings.', 'Art'),

In your print Reptiles you have given such a striking illustration of reincarnation.'' I replied, ''Madame, if that''s the way you see it, so be it, ''" An engagingly sly comment by the renowned Dutch graphic artist Maurits Cornelis Escher (1898-1972)--the complex ambiguities of whose work leave hasty or single-minded interpretations far behind. Long before the first computer-generated 3-D images were thrilling the public, Escher was a master of the third dimension. His lithograph "Magic Mirror" dates as far back as 1946. In taking that title for this book, mathematician Bruno Ernst is stressing the magic spell Escher''s work invariably casts on those who see it. Ernst visited Escher every week for a year, systematically talking through his entire oeuvre with him. Their discussions resulted in a friendship that gave Ernst intimate access to the life and conceptual world of Escher. Ernst''s account was meticulously scrutinized and made accurate by the artist himself. Escher''s work refuses to be pigeonholed. Scientific, psychological, or aesthetic criteria alone cannot do it justice. The questions remain. Why did he create the pictures? How did he construct them? What preliminary studies were necessary before he could arrive at the final version? And how are the various images Escher created interrelated? This book, complete with biographical data, 250 illustrations, and explications of mathematical problems, offers answers to these and many other questions, and is an authentic source text of the first order.', 'Art'),

It is this quality that has helped to make them enduring models for builders of later periods. This extensively illustrated book, the first full-length study of the concept of monumentality in Classical Antiquity, asks what it is that the notion encompasses and how significant it was for the Romans themselves in molding their individual or collective aspirations and identities. Although no single word existed in antiquity for the qualities that modern authors regard as making up that term, its Latin derivation--from monumentum, "a monument"--attests plainly to the presence of the concept in the mentalities of ancient Romans, and the development of that notion through the Roman era laid the foundation for the classical ideal of monumentality, which reached a height in early modern Europe. This book is also the first full-length study of architecture in the Antonine Age--when it is generally agreed the Roman Empire was at its height. By exploring the public architecture of Roman Italy and both Western and Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire from the point of view of the benefactors who funded such buildings, the architects who designed them, and the public who used and experienced them, Edmund Thomas analyzes the reasons why Roman builders sought to construct monumental buildings and uncovers the close link between architectural monumentality and the identity and ideology of the Roman Empire itself.', 'Art'),

Before leaving for Malta in April 1804, Coleridge wrote "I have learnt as much fr om] Sir George Beaumont respecting Pictures & Painting and Paint ers as] I ever learnt on any subject from any man in the same Space of Time." <br> In Italy in 1806, Coleridge''s experience of art deepened, thanks to the American artist Washington Allston, who taught him to see the artistic sights of Rome with a painter''s eye. Coleridge also visited Florence and Pisa, and later said of the frescoes in Pisa''s Camp Santo: "The impression was greater, I may say, than that any poem ever made upon me." <br> Back in England, Coleridge visited London exhibitions, country house collections, and even artists'' studios. In 1814, both Coleridge and Allston were in Bristol--Coleridge lecturing, Allston exhibiting. Coleridge''s "On the Principles of Genial Criticism" began as a defense of Allston''s paintings but became a statement about all the arts. <br> This book, an important contribution to Coleridge''s intellectual biography, will make readers aware of a dimension of his thinking that has been largely ignored until now.', 'Art'),

Or is it? That was the issue at stake when in 1919 a returning doughboy named Harry Hahn and his French bride Andree attempted to sell what they thought was a genuine Da Vinci in New York. Renowned art dealer Sir Joseph Duveen declared the picture--La Belle Ferronniere--a fake without ever seeing the canvas. The Hahns sued Duveen for slander, setting off a legal battle that would embroil the art world for decades.<br> In The American Leonardo, John Brewer uses this high drama as a vehicle to reveal how authority, expertise, and value are all culturally derived and situated. The trial of the Hahn Belle raised larger questions about how attributions are made, how they affect both the status and value of art works, and how the entire system of art dealers, curators, and connoisseurs authenticates works of art. In the early twentieth century new methods of scientific analysis developed, which meant that for the first time, the critical eye of the connoisseur had to contend with an emerging array of scientific and forensic tests that (however crude in their inception) promised a degree of objectivity and reliability unattainable before. Brewer shows how the tension between the two methods of attribution lay at the heart of the Hahn La Belle dispute, which continues to this day. <br> For artists and art-lovers, collectors and curators--and for anyone who''s ever stood in front of a painting and wondered about its story--The American Leonardo offers a discerning and entertaining view into the art world as it tries to separate Old Masters from modern mountebanks. <br> Praise for John Brewer''s The Pleasures of the Imagination:<br> "Like all really original achievements, it makes us sharply rethink things we supposed we knew well."<br> -Simon Schama<br> "Lively A sea change in historical writing."<br> --Peter Ackroyd, The Times', 'Art'),

Each painting is displayed in a two-page spread, with Dr. Southgate''s essay on the work on the facing page. The volume includes works by Marc Chagall, Leonardo da Vinci, James Ensor, Paul Gauguin, Frida Kahlo, RenA(c) Magritte, Adouard Manet, Edvard Munch, Georgia O''Keeffe, Rembrandt van Rijn, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Vincent van Gogh, and many more.

From John Ruskin''s five-volume celebration of J. M.W. Turner to Walter Pater''s essays on the Italian Renaissance, Victorian writers disseminated a new idea in the nineteenth century, that art spectatorship could provide one of the most intense and meaningful forms of human experience. <br> In The Literate Eye, Rachel Teukolsky analyzes the vivid archive of Victorian art writing to reveal the key role played by nineteenth-century authors in the rise of modernist aesthetics. Though traditional accounts locate a break between Victorian values and the experimental styles of the twentieth century, Teukolsky traces how certain art writers promoted a formalism that would come to dominate canons of twentieth-century art. Well-known texts by Ruskin, Pater, and Wilde appear alongside lesser-known texts drawn from the rich field of Victorian print culture, including gallery reviews, scientific treatises, satirical cartoons, and tracts on early photography. Spanning the years 1840 to 1910, her argument lends a new understanding to the transition from Victorianism to modernism, a period of especially lively exchange between artists and intellectuals, here narrated with careful attention to the historical particularities and real events that informed British aesthetic values. <br> Lavishly illustrated and marked by meticulous research, The Literate Eye offers an eloquent argument for the influence of Victorian art culture on the museum worlds of modernism, in a revisionary account that ultimately relocates the notion of "the modern" to the heart of the nineteenth century.', 'Art'),

Traditionally, the left side was<br>regarded as evil, weak, and worldly, but with the Renaissance, artists began to represent the left side as the side that represented authentic human feelings and especially love. Writers including Lorenzo de'' Medici, Michelangelo, and Winckelmann hailed the supreme moral and aesthetic beauty of the<br>left side. Images of lovers foreground the left side of the body, emphasizing its refinement and sensitivity. In the late nineteenth century, with the rise of interest in the occult and in spiritualism, the left side becomes associated with the taboo and with the unconscious. James Hall''s insightful<br>discussion of left and right symbolism helps us to see how the self and the mind were perceived during these periods, and gives us a new key to understanding art in its social and intellectual context.', 'Art'),

The Insula of<br>the Menander, approximately 3500 sq. m. in area, derives its name from the House of the Menander, one of the best-known dwellings of the ancient city. This was evidently the property of one of Pompeii''s leading citizens. Renowned for its architectural grandeur and for the hoard of 110 pieces of<br>silver plate found in a cellar, it also yielded room upon room of splendid wall-paintings and mosaic pavements, ranging in date from the first century BC to the eve of the eruption of AD 79. In addition to this dominant house, the block contains several smaller houses--notably the House of the<br>Lovers and the House of the Craftsman--most of which contain further paintings and pavements of interest.

Its importance lies in the fact that it covers the whole block, rather than concentrating upon isolated houses (as most<br>previous volumes have done).

However the agnostic stance of the Lead character in Three mistake is an exception. Besides, a special importance to sex is given in each of his books. The friends of the Protagonist are also of very common nature. The girls in the novels are shown in virtual bondage by their respective families. Yet even the girls can be easily compared to an average Indian girl. Thus, the novel has no weird characters and is really set in a typical Indian setting. The characters are all typical neighbourhood characters and this is what makes the novels a success. <br />Chetan also writes op-ed columns for leading English and Hindi newspapers, focusing on youth and national development based issues. Many of the issues raised by Chetan&rsquo;s columns have been discussed in Parliament and among the top leadership of the country. <br />Chetan quit his international investment banking career in 2009, to devote his entire time to writing and make change happen in the country. He lives in Mumbai with his wife Anusha, an ex-classmate from IIMA and his twin boys Shyam and Ishaan.</td>  </tr>  </tbody>  </table>  <br />  <p><strong>Chetan Bhagat''s Favorite Books and what makes them special to Him - </strong></p>  <ul>  <li><a href="http://www.infibeam.com/Books/info/J-D-Salinger/The-Catcher-in-the-Rye/0316769487.html">Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger</a> -- It is the classic teenage voice book.

We also tend to think of iconoclasts as barbaric. Iconoclasts are people like the Taliban, who blew up Buddhist statues in 2001. We tend, that is, to look with horror on iconoclasm. <br>This book argues instead that iconoclasm is a central strand of Anglo-American modernity. Our horror at the destruction of art derives in part from the fact that we too did, and still do, that. This is most obviously true of England''s iconoclastic century between 1538 and 1643. That century of legislated early modern image breaking, exceptional in Europe for its jurisdictional extension and duration, stands at the core of this book. That''s when written texts, especially poems, rather than visual images became our living monuments. <br>Surely, though, the story of image breaking stops in the eighteenth century, with its enlightened cultivation of the visual arts and the art market. Not so, argues Under the Hammer: once started, iconoclasm is difficult to stop. It ripples through cultures, into the psyche, and it ripples through history. Museums may have protected images from the iconoclast''s hammer, but also subject images to metaphorical iconoclasm. Aesthetics may have drawn a protective circle around the image, but as it did so, it also neutralised the image. <br>The ripple effect also continues across the Atlantic, into puritan culture, into twentieth-century American Abstract Expressionism, and into the puritan temple of modern art. That, in fact, is where this book starts, with mid-twentieth-century abstract painting: the image has survived, just, but it bears the scars of a 500 year history.', 'Art'),

In recent years, however, thepresumption of unrepeatability and immobility encapsulated in Richard Serra''s famousdictum "to remove the work is to destroy the work" is being challenged by new modelsof site specificity and changes in institutional and market forces.One Place afterAnother offers a critical history of site-specific art since the late 1960s and atheoretical framework for examining the rhetoric of aesthetic vanguardism andpolitical progressivism associated with its many permutations. Informed by urbantheory, postmodernist criticism in art and architecture, and debates concerningidentity politics and the public sphere, the book addresses the siting of art asmore than an artistic problem. It examines site specificity as a complex cipher ofthe unstable relationship between location and identity in the era of latecapitalism.

When a hero falters, the action stops and everyone weighs in with a different and often contradictory take on dharma. The epic''s characters are flawed, but their incoherent experiences throw light on our familiar dilemmas.<br /><br />Gurcharan Das''s best-selling book India Unbound examined the classical aim of artha, material well being. This, his first book in seven years, dwells on the goal of dharma, moral well being. It addresses the central problem of how to live our lives in an examined way-holding a mirror up to us and<br /><br />forcing us to confront the many ways in which we deceive ourselves and others. What emerges is a doctrine of dharma that we can apply to our business decisions, political strategies and interpersonal relationships-in effect, to life itself.<br /><br /><strong>About The Author :</strong></p>  <p><strong>Gurcharan Das</strong> is an author and management consultant.

Now, with the paperback of Voyages of the Self, this esteemed critic completes the trilogy begun with the two earlier works, offering once again an exhilarating exploration of American art and culture. In this book, Novak explores several inspired pairings of key writers and painters, drawing insightful parallels between such masters as John Singleton Copley and Jonathan Edwards, Winslow Homer and William James, Frederic Edwin Church and Walt Whitman, and Jackson Pollock and Charles Olson. Through these and other groupings, Novak tracks the varied meanings of the self in America, in which the most salient characteristics of each artist or writer is shown to draw from--and in turn influence--the larger map of American life. Two major threads weaving through the book are the American preoccupation with the "object" and our continuing return to pragmatism.

Issues about the creation of works, what is essential and inessential to their identity, their distinct kinds of properties, including aesthetic properties, their amenability to interpretation, their style, the conditions under which they can go out of existence, and their relation to perceptually indistinguishable doubles (e.g. forgeries and parodies), are raised and debated. A core theme is that works like paintings, music, literature, sculpture, architecture, films, photographs, multi-media installations, and many more besides, have fundamental features in common, as cultural artefacts, in spite of enormous surface differences. It is their nature as distinct kinds of things, grounded in distinct ontological categories, that is the subject of this enquiry. Although much of the discussion is abstract, based in analytical metaphysics, there are numerous specific applications, including a study of Jean-Paul Sartre''s novel La Nausee and recent conceptual art. Some surprising conclusions are derived, about the identity conditions of works and about the difference, often, between what a work seems to be and what it really is.', 'Art'),

This new book-Richard Helgerson''s first since the highly acclaimed "Forms of Nationhood"-shows that each contributed to a common project of enormous significance: the artistic promotion of the middle-class home. In a study that stretches over two centuries and four countries, Helgerson unearths the shared preoccupations of European domestic drama and painting. The result is an unexpected prehistory of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century cult of domesticity. <br>"Adulterous Alliances" focuses on English, Spanish, and French drama from the 1590s through the late eighteenth century and on seventeenth-century Dutch painting. Helgerson finds that these plays and paintings register not only a new interest in nonaristocratic homes, but also an attention to the relation between those homes and the monarchic state. Domestic drama and painting emerged, he argues, as a by-product of early modern state formation, and defined themselves by their difference from the newly invented or revived genres of state: history painting, tragedy, historical drama, and history itself. <br>Again and again, as Helgerson shows, the home and the marriage on which it is based are disrupted by a sexually predatory intruder-one who comes most often from the sphere of the state: a soldier, a courtier, a leading aristocrat, or even the king himself. And almost as often, the state intervenes to resolve the problem that it or its agents create. But whether savior or perpetrator, the state is always outshone by the home through which it expresses its power. The nonaristocratic home emerges not simply as an adjunct of statepower, but as an alternative to it-a space that by the late eighteenth century would make its own claim as the ground for a revolutionary new order.', 'Art'),

Grounding her analysis in the social and historical context of traditional royalty systems, Coquet examines the diverse roles played by artisans, nobles, and kings in the production and use of royal objects. From the precolonial kingdoms of the Edo and the Yoruba, the Ashanti and the Igbo, Coquet reconstructs from a comparativist view the essential cultural connections between art, representation, and the king. <br>More than ornamentation, royal objects embodied the strength and status of African rulers. The gold-plated stools of the Ashanti, the delicately carved ivory bracelets of the Edo-these objects were meant not simply to adorn but to affirm and enhance the power and prestige of the wearer. Unlike the abstract style frequently seen in African ritual art, realism became manifest in courtly arts. Realism directly linked the symbolic value of the object-a portrait or relief-with the physical person of the king. The contours of the monarch''s face, his political and military exploits rendered on palace walls, became visual histories, the work of art in essence corroborating the ruler''s sovereign might. <br>Richly illustrated and wonderfully detailed, Coquet''s influential volume offers both a splendid visual presentation and an authoritative analysis of African royal arts. <br>"[This] beautiful and exciting book emphasizes the skillful court art of the Benin, Dahomey, and the Kongo.

As objects of fury and force, these works are intended to protect and empower people and cultures that have long been oppressed. <br>In this first major study of its kind, Suzanne Preston Blier examines the artworks of the contemporary "vodun" cultures of southern Benin and Togo in West Africa as well as the related "voudou" traditions of Haiti, New Orleans, and historic Salem, Massachusetts.

She examines the relation between art and the slave trade, the psychological dynamics of artistic expression, the significance of the body in sculptural expression, and indigenous perceptions of the psyche. <br>Throughout, Blier pushes African art history to a new height of cultural awareness that recognizes the complexity of traditional African societies as it acknowledges the role of social power in shaping aesthetics and meaning generally.

Arguing against this carefully crafted pop image, Reva Wolf shows that Warhol was in fact deeply emotionally engaged with the people around him and that this was reflected in his art. <br>Wolf investigates the underground culture of poets, artists, and filmmakers who interacted with Warhol regularly.

The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives. <br>Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don''t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the "impossible." <br>For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don''t know.

Sleinis discusses visual art, literature, music, theater, and other art forms, arguing that as art both liberates and provides new points of focus and awareness, the art enterprise depends on a positive freeing from the nonart world, rather than on mere addition to it. Art and Freedom introduces a novel classificatory system for representation, expression, and formalist theories of art. Sleinis argues that a characteristic defect of contemporary theories of art is their neglect of the issue of value. Challenging these reductive, formalist notions of art, he emphasizes the potential, and the need, for art to evolve and make progress in ways comparable to the sciences, albeit on a very different model.

Ram Charan is a legendary advisor to senior executives and boards of directors, a man with unparalleled insight into why some companies are successful and others are not. Together they''ve pooled their knowledge and experience into the one book on how to close the gap between results promised and results delivered that people in business need today. <br />After a long, stellar career with General Electric, Larry Bossidy transformed AlliedSignal into one of the world''s most admired companies and was named CEO of the year in 1998 by "Chief Executive magazine. Accomplishments such as 31 consecutive quarters of earnings-per-share growth of 13 percent or more didn''t just happen; they resulted from the consistent practice of the discipline of execution: understanding how to link together people, strategy, and operations, the three core processes of every business. <br />Leading these processes is the real job of running a business, not formulating a "vision" and leaving the work of carrying it out to others. Bossidy and Charan show the importance of being deeply and passionately engaged in an organization and why robust dialogues about people, strategy, and operations result in a business based on intellectual honesty and realism. <br />The leader''s most important job--selecting and appraising people--is one that should never be delegated. As a CEO, Larry Bossidy personally makes the calls to check references for key hires. Why?With the right people in the right jobs, there''s a leadership gene pool that conceives and selects strategies that can be executed. People then work together to create a strategy building block by building block, a strategy in sync with the realities of the marketplace, the economy, and the competition. Once the right people and strategy are in place, they are then linked to an operating process that results in the implementation of specific programs and actions and that assigns accountability. This kind of effective operating process goes way beyond the typical budget exercise that looks into a rearview mirror to set its goals. It puts reality behind the numbers and is where the rubber meets the road. <br />Putting an execution culture in place is hard, but losing it is easy. In July 2001 Larry Bossidy was asked by the board of directors of Honeywell International (it had merged with AlliedSignal) to return and get the company back on track. He''s been putting the ideas he writes about in Execution to work in real time.</p>', 'Business and Economics'),

In Great by Choice - based on nine years of research, buttressed by rigorous analysis and infused with engaging stories - Collins and his colleague, Morten Hansen, enumerate the principles for building a truly great enterprise in unpredictable, tumultuous, and fast-moving times.</p>  <p>No mere sequel, Great by Choice distinguishes itself from Collins''s prior work by its focus not just on performance, but also on the type of unstable environments faced by leaders today. With a team of more than twenty researchers, Collins and Hansen studied companies that rose to greatness - beating their industry indexes by a minimum of ten times over fifteen years - in environments characterized by big forces and rapid shifts that leaders could not predict or control. The research team then contrasted these "10X companies" to a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to achieve greatness in similarly extreme environments.</p>  <p><strong>THE NEW FINDINGS </strong></p>  <p><strong>The study results were full of provocative surprises. Such as: </strong></p>  <p><strong>*</strong> The best leaders were not more risk taking, more visionary, and more creative than the comparisons; they were more disciplined, more empirical, and more paranoid.</p>  <p><strong>*</strong> Innovation by itself turns out not to be the trump card in a chaotic and uncertain world; more important is the ability to scale innovation, to blend creativity with discipline.</p>  <p><strong>*</strong> Following the belief that leading in a "fast world" always requires "fast decisions" and "fast action" is a good way to get killed.</p>  <p><strong>*</strong> The great companies changed less in reaction to a radically changing world than the comparison companies.</p>  <p>The authors challenge conventional wisdom with thought-provoking, sticky, and supremely practical concepts. They include 10Xers, the 20 Mile March, Fire Bullets then Cannonballs, Leading above the Death Line, Zoom Out, Then Zoom In, and SMaC recipe.</p>  <p>Finally, in the last chapter, Collins and Hansen present their most provocative and original analysis: defining, quantifying, and studying the role of luck. The great companies and the leaders who built them were not luckier than the comparisons, but they did get a higher Return on Luck. This book is classic Collins: contrarian, data driven, and uplifting. He and Hansen show convincingly that, even in a chaotic and uncertain world, greatness happens by choice, not by chance.</p>  <p><strong>About the Author&nbsp; :</strong></p>  <p><strong>Jim Collins</strong> is author or coauthor of six books, including the bestsellers Good to Great, Built to Last, and How the Mighty Fall, which have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.

Into his wide-ranging cultural inquiry Boime incorporates not only frequently studied mainstream artists and sculptors but also neglected and lesser known artists and unattributed popular imagery. He examines popular as well as official culture, the family as well as the state, and the conditions of the poor as well as of the affluent that affected cultural practice. <br>This inaugural volume explores the artistic repercussions of the major political and economic events of the latter half of the eighteenth century: the Seven Years'' War, the French Revolution, and the English industrial revolution. Boime examines the prerevolutionary popularity of the rococo style and the emergence of the cult of antiquity that followed the Seven Years'' War. He shows how the continual experiments of Jacques-Louis David and others with neoclassical symbols and themes in the latter part of the century actively contributed to the transformation of French and English politics.

Henry VIII is on the throne, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is his chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. Into this atmosphere of distrust and need comes Thomas Cromwell, first as Wolsey''s clerk, and later his successor. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events. Ruthless in pursuit of his own interests, he is as ambitious in his wider politics as he is for himself. His reforming agenda is carried out in the grip of a self-interested parliament and a king who fluctuates between romantic passions and murderous rages. From one of our finest living writers, Wolf Hall is that very rare thing: a truly great English novel, one that explores the intersection of individual psychology and wider politics. With a vast array of characters, and richly overflowing with incident, it peels back history to show us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself with great passion and suffering and courage.</p><br/><br/>From The Washington Post''s Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Wendy Smith Henry VIII''s quest to make Anne Boleyn his queen has inspired reams of historical fiction, much of it trashy and most of it trite. Yet from this seemingly shopworn material, Hilary Mantel has created a novel both fresh and finely wrought: a brilliant portrait of a society in the throes of disorienting change, anchored by a penetrating character study of Henry''s formidable adviser, Thomas Cromwell. It''s no wonder that her masterful book won the Man Booker Prize last week. Mantel''s choice of protagonist signals her intelligence and artistic ambition. Cromwell was the quintessential 16th-century New Man, the son of a blacksmith who rose through Cardinal Wolsey''s patronage and survived the cardinal''s downfall to become the most powerful civil servant in Tudor England. Historians have long acknowledged Cromwell as the administrative genius who transformed a medieval fiefdom into a modern nation-state, but only an exceedingly bold novelist could envision this odyssey as the stuff of gripping fiction. From the moment we see young Thomas knocked to the ground by his brutal father to the grim final scene at the execution of his enemy Thomas More in 1535, readers are intimately engaged in Cromwell''s emotions and calculations. Mantel puts us inside the head of this secretive, complicated man, illuminating motives often misunderstood by others. Convincing Henry that only he can deliver the marriage and the absolute authority the king wants is a means to an end; Cromwell intends to make England a better place for the common people among whom he was born by destroying the corrupt Catholic clergy he despises and limiting the power of the entrenched aristocrats who despise him. He plans to get very rich along the way. Cromwell understands this better than anyone else in the novel. He observes, evaluates and makes his moves, but never shows his hand. He''s a committed, albeit covert Protestant who runs uncharacteristic risks to protect the new movement''s more militant adherents from the heretic-burning More (acidly depicted as a cruel, sanctimonious egomaniac nothing like the saintly hero of ''A Man for All Seasons''). But Cromwell realizes that Henry, who would happily remain Catholic if the pope would just give him what he wants, can only be led to the Reformation through his desire for Anne Boleyn. And though Cromwell respects Anne, a fellow upstart on the make, he''s not staking his career on her ability to arrest the king''s roving eye. ''Any little girl can hold the key to the future,'' he thinks as he chats with mousy young lady-in-waiting Jane Seymour. The Seymour family estate, Wolf Hall, gives the novel its title; the scandalous goings-on there -- Jane''s father has been caught in flagrante with his son''s wife -- serve as a metaphor for the licentious, overprivileged society through which Cromwell adroitly maneuvers. Alone among the self-absorbed plotters at Henry''s court, he sees that this society is increasingly irrelevant. Listening to a disgruntled earl pontificate about ''ancient rights,'' Cromwell wonders how he can explain real life to this clueless nobleman. ''The world is not run from where he thinks. Not from his border fortresses, not even from Whitehall. The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from places he has never imagined . . . not from castle walls, but from countinghouses, not by the call of a bugle but by the click of the abacus.'' Cromwell belongs to this rising global order; he''s been a wool trader in Antwerp and a banker in Florence, as well as a foot soldier in some continental army and a cook in an Italian kitchen. Sophisticated yet down-to-earth, he''s not intimidated by England''s insular elite, though he recognizes the power it holds. If Anne has a son and Henry lives another 20 years to bequeath the crown to an adult heir, he reckons, ''I can build my own prince: to the glorification of God and the commonwealth of England.'' That doesn''t happen, of course, though resourceful Cromwell survives Elizabeth''s birth and climbs still higher as the indispensable facilitator of Henry''s schemes. Yet even readers unaware that he fell from favor and was executed as a traitor in 1540 -- five years beyond the novel''s close and never hinted at in the text -- will sense that Cromwell''s success can''t last. The bleakly knowing veteran of poverty, prejudice and loss delineated here surely senses it, too. A fiercely loyal friend, determined protector of kin, mentor of sharp young plebeians wherever he finds them, Cromwell nonetheless takes it as a given that ''man is wolf to man.'' Mantel has explored this uncomfortable idea in previous works, discerning no more kindness among the contemporary characters in ''Vacant Possession'' or ''Beyond Black'' than among the 18th-century combatants in ''The Giant, O''Brien'' or ''A Place of Greater Safety.'' Like these predecessors, ''Wolf Hall'' is uncompromising and unsentimental, though alert readers will detect an underlying strain of gruff tenderness. Similarly, Mantel''s prose is as plain as her protagonist (who''s sensitive about his looks), but also (like Cromwell) extraordinarily flexible, subtle and shrewd. Enfolding cogent insights into the human soul within a lucid analysis of the social, economic and personal interactions that drive political developments, Mantel has built on her previous impressive achievements to write her best novel yet.<br/>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

The period, which gave rise to such luminaries as Karl Marx and Charles Darwin, was also characterized by civic upheaval, quantum leaps in science and technology, and the increasing secularization of intellectual pursuits and ordinary life. In a sweeping narrative that adds critical depth to a key epoch in modern art''s history, "Art in an Age of Civil Struggle" shows how this turbulent social environment served as an incubator for the mid-nineteenth century''s most important artists and writers. <br>Tracing the various movements of realism through the major metropolitan centers of Europe and America, Boime strikingly evokes the milieus that shaped the lives and works of Gustave Courbet, Edouard Manet, Emile Zola, HonorE Daumier, Walt Whitman, Abraham Lincoln, and the earliest photographers, among countless others. In doing so, he spearheads a powerful new way of reassessing how art emerges from the welter of cultural and political events and the artist''s struggle to interpret his surroundings. Boime supports this multifaceted approach with a wealth of illustrations and written sources that demonstrate the intimate links between visual culture and social change. Culminating at the transition to impressionism, "Art in an Age of Civil Struggle" makes historical sense of a movement that paved the way for avant-garde aesthetics and, more broadly, of how a particular style emerges at a particular moment.', 'Art'),

Art created in pursuit of personal expression. In "Art in an Age of Counterrevolution," Albert Boime rejects these popular modern notions and suggests that history--not internal drive or expressive urge--as the dynamic force that shapes art. <br>This volume focuses on the astonishing range of art forms currently understood to fall within the broad category of Romanticism. Drawing on visual media and popular imagery of the time, this generously illustrated work examines the art of Romanticism as a reaction to the social and political events surrounding it. Boime reinterprets canonical works by such politicized artists as Goya, Delacroix, Gericault, Friedrich, and Turner, framing their work not by personality but by its sociohistorical context. Boime''s capacious approach and scope allows him to incorporate a wide range of perspectives into his analysis of Romantic art, including Marxism, social history, gender identity, ecology, structuralism, and psychoanalytic theory, a reach that parallels the work of contemporary cultural historians and theorists such as Edward Said, Pierre Bourdieu, Eric Hobsbawm, Frederic Jameson, and T. J. Clark. <br>Boime ultimately establishes that art serves the interests and aspirations of the cultural bourgeoisie. In grounding his arguments on their work and its scope and influence, he elucidates how all artists are inextricably linked to history. This book will be used widely in art history courses and exert enormous influence on cultural studies as well.', 'Art'),

In "Art in Mind," Ernst van Alphen probes this idea of art as a commanding force with the capacity to shape our intellect and intervene in our lives. Rather than interpreting art as merely a reflection of our social experience or a product of history, van Alphen here argues that art is a historical agent, or a cultural creator, that propels thought and experience forward. <p>Examining a broad range of works, van Alphen2;a renowned art historian and critic of cultural theory2;demonstrates how art serves a socially constructive function by actually experimenting with the parameters of thought. Employing work from artists as diverse as Picasso, Watteau, Francis Bacon, Marlene Dumas, and Matthew Barney, he shows how art confronts its viewers with the "pain points" of cultural experience2;genocide, sexuality, diaspora, and transcultural identity2;and thereby transforms the ways in which human existence is conceived. Van Alphen analyzes how art visually "thinks" about these difficult cultural issues, tapping into an understudied interpretation of art as the realm where ideas and values are actively created, given form, and mobilized. In this way, van Alphen''s book is a work of art in itself as it educates us in a new mode of thought that will forge equally new approaches and responses to the world. <p>"This book advances a strong and original claim: that art, in this case contemporary art, thinks. And in this study, thought is always visual. The style is clear, animated, and free of jargon. Anyone interested in contemporary art or philosophy will find this bookinformative, thought provoking, and rewarding."2;Norman Bryson, author of" Looking at the Overlooked" <br>"A highly original interdisciplinary study about the functions of the image in contemporary art and literature.

If engraving or inscription assigns value, then the first widely produced artistic "reproductions" were coins, acting as religious icons with a meaning at once spiritual and material. In the first half of the book, Shell establishes an ongoing interaction between symbolization in currency and aesthetic production. He covers a range of issues from the iconoclast controversies to nuances of Christian doctrine on the materiality of money and the significance of liturgical objects, from the Eucharist wafer to the Holy Grail to the use of precious metals in Christian icons. Shell then focuses on money in the United States. He takes up controversies over the gold standard, the development of paper currency in nineteenth-century America, and the activities of minimalist, conceptualist, and investment artists in the 1960s that led to dematerialization of art and money in electronic exchange. Art & Money provides striking insight into current matters of art collection, counterfeiting, and problems of attribution, into the general relation between word and image, and into controversies over taxation and crises or scandals in the financial world. Shell''s historical range is immense, and he fills this study with amusing anecdotes and insights ranging from the relic of the Holy Foreskin to the state''s arrest of J. S. G. Boggs, a conceptual artist who draws money.<br>In our age of art as investment and of skyrocketing prices at the gallery and the auction house, the study of art and money has become urgent--at least for investors and cultural critics. At the same time, crises in finance have disrupted economic and credit institutions and in turn assumptions about the value of art. "Art & Money" is a frank, provocative, and entirely unconventional look at two worlds in tandem, focusing on what binds together and drives apart the realms of art and money. Profusely illustrated, it investigates how money becomes (or is) artwork and how artwork comes to assume some of the characteristics of money. <br>Unlike traditional approaches to the topic, "Art & Money" is not a study of money and exchange as an artistic "theme." It is also not a study of economics as a context for the history of art. Rather, it is a path-breaking exploration of the internal logic--the set of meanings and values--common to both money and art. <br>"Art & Money" provides striking insight into current matters of art collection, counterfeiting, and problems of attribution, into the general relation between word and image, and into controversies over taxation and crises or scandals in the financial world.

But acknowledging that art is a universal part of human experience leads us to some big questions: Why does it exist? Why do we enjoy it? And how do the world''s different art traditions relate to art and to each other?"Art Without Borders" is an extraordinary exploration of those questions, a profound and personal meditation on the human hunger for art and a dazzling synthesis of the whole range of inquiry into its significance. Esteemed thinker Ben-Ami Scharfstein''s encyclopedic erudition is here brought to bear on the full breadth of the world of art. He draws on neuroscience and psychology to understand the way we both perceive and conceive of art, including its resistance to verbal exposition. Through examples of work by Indian, Chinese, European, African, and Australian artists, "Art Without Borders" probes the distinction between accepting a tradition and defying it through innovation, which leads to a consideration of the notion of artistic genius. Continuing in this comparative vein, Scharfstein examines the mutual influence of European and non-European artists. Then, through a comprehensive evaluation of the world''s major art cultures, he shows how all of these individual traditions are gradually, but haltingly, conjoining into a single current of universal art. Finally, he concludes by looking at the ways empathy and intuition can allow members of one culture to appreciate the art of another.Lucid, learned, and incomparably rich in thought and detail, "Art Without Borders" is a monumental accomplishment, on par with the artistic achievements Scharfstein writes about so lovingly inits pages.', 'Art'),

A prime example of the artisan-scholar so prevalent in the late Renaissance, Oddi was also accomplished in the fields of civil and military architecture and the design and retail of mathematical instruments, as well as writing and publishing.&#160; &#160; In "Between Raphael and Galileo," Alexander Marr resurrects the career and achievements of Oddi in order to examine the ways in which mathematics, material culture, and the book shaped knowledge, society, and the visual arts in late Renaissance Italy. Marr scrutinizes the extensive archive of Oddi papers, documenting Oddi&#8217;s collaboration with prominent intellectuals and officials and shedding new light on the practice of science and art during his day. What becomes clear is that Oddi, precisely because he was not spectacularly innovative and did not attain the status of a hero in modern science, is characteristic of the majority of scientific practitioners and educators active in this formative age, particularly those whose energetic popularization of mathematics laid the foundations for the Scientific Revolution. Marr also demonstrates that scientific change in this era was multivalent and contested, governed as much by friendship as by principle and determined as much by places as by purpose. &#160; Plunging the reader into Oddi&#8217;s world, "Between Raphael and Galileo" is a finely wrought and meticulously researched tale of science, art, commerce, and society in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century.

Yet sixteenth-century French kings believed they were the heirs of imperial Rome and commissioned a magnificent array of visual arts to secure their hopes of political ascendancy with images of overflowing abundance. With a wide-ranging yet richly detailed interdisciplinary approach, Rebecca Zorach examines the visual culture of the French Renaissance, where depictions of sacrifice, luxury, fertility, violence, metamorphosis, and sexual excess are central. Zorach looks at the cultural, political, and individual roles that played out in these artistic themes and how, eventually, these aesthetics of exuberant abundance disintegrated amidst perceptions of decadent excess. <br>Throughout the book, abundance and excess flow in liquids-blood, milk, ink, and gold-that highlight the materiality of objects and the human body, and explore the value (and values) accorded to them. The arts of the lavish royal court at Fontainebleau and in urban centers are here explored in a vibrant tableau that illuminates our own contemporary relationship to excess and desire. <br>From marvelous works by Francois Clouet to oversexed ornamental prints to Benvenuto Cellini''s golden saltcellar fashioned for Francis I, "Blood, Milk, Ink, Gold" covers an astounding range of subjects with precision and panache, producing the most lucid, well-rounded portrait of the cultural politics of the French Renaissance to date.<br>', 'Art'),

Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. For what Taleb calls the ''antifragile'' is beyond the merely robust; it benefits from shocks, uncertainty and stressors. Antifragile is about what to do when we don''t understand. It is a new word because it is a new concept.</p>  <p>Many of the greatest breakthroughs in human endeavour come from the innovation by trial and error that is part of antifragility. And some of the best systems we know of, including natural selection and evolution, have antifragility at their heart. How did the disaster of the sinking of the Titanic bring us closer to safety? Why does the stress on bones make us stronger? Why should you write a resignation letter on your first day in the office? Why should we detest the lack of accountability at the heart of capitalism? The most successful of us, the most daring and creative will take advantage of disorder and invent new, more powerful opportunities and advantages beyond our expectations.</p>  <p>Irreverent and ambitious, Antifragile provides a blueprint for how to live-and thrive-in a world we don''t understand, and which is too uncertain for us to even try to predict. Taleb''s message is revolutionary: what is not antifragile will surely perish.</p>  <p><strong>About the Author :</strong></p>  <p><strong>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</strong> is a radical and paradoxical philosopher for our times. He has spent his life immersing himself in problems of luck, uncertainty, probability, and knowledge, and he has led three high-profile careers around his ideas, as a man of letters, as a businessman-trader, and as a university professor and researcher. He is currently Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at New York University''s Polytechnic Institute.

Nina M. Athanassoglou-Kallmyer argues that, far from an escapist venture like Gauguin''s stay in Brittany or Monet''s visits to Normandy, Cezanne''s departure from Paris was a deliberate abandonment intimately connected with late-nineteenth-century French regionalist politics. <br>Like many of his childhood friends, Cezanne detested the homogenizing effects of modernism and bourgeois capitalism on the culture, people, and landscapes of his beloved Provence. Turning away from the mainstream modernist aesthetic of his impressionist years, Cezanne sought instead to develop a new artistic tradition more evocative of his Provencal heritage. Athanassoglou-Kallmyer shows that Provence served as a distinct and defining cultural force that shaped all aspects of Cezanne''s approach to representation, including subject matter, style, and technical treatment. For instance, his self-portraits and portraits of family members reflect a specifically Provencal sense of identity. And Cezanne''s Provencal landscapes express an increasingly traditionalist style firmly grounded in details of local history and even geology. These landscapes, together with images of bathers, cardplayers, and other figures, were key facets of Cezanne''s imaginary reconstruction of Provence as primordial and idyllic--a modern French Arcadia. <br>Highly original and lavishly illustrated, "Cezanne and Provence" gives us an entirely new Cezanne: no longer the quintessential icon of generic, depersonalized modernism, but instead a self-consciously provincial innovator of mainstream styles deeply influenced by Provencal culture, places, and politics.', 'Art'),

Approaching art as a form of erotic expression that connects sensory richness with primal desire, Grosz finds that the meaning of art comes from the intensities and sensations it inspires, not just its intention and aesthetic.<p>By regarding our most cultured human accomplishments as the result of the excessive, nonfunctional forces of sexual attraction and seduction, Grosz encourages us to see art as a kind of bodily enhancement or mode of sensation that enables living bodies to experience the universe. Art can be understood as a way for bodies to augment themselves and their capacity for perception and affection-a way to grow and evolve through sensation. Through this framework, which knits together the theories of Charles Darwin, Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze, FA(c)lix Guattari, and Jacob von UexkA1/4ll we are able to grasp art''s deep animal lineage. Art is not tied to the predictable and known but linked to new futures not contained in the present. Its animal affiliations ensure that art is intensely political and charged with the creation of new worlds and new forms of living. It is the way in which life experiments with materiality, or nature, in order to bring about change.', 'Art'),

This book is the first to present this essential measuring stick and to prove the link between employee opinions and productivity, profit, customer satisfaction, and the rate of turnover.</p>', 'Business and Economics'),

Riis was not alone in his belief that beauty could tame urban chaos, but are aesthetic experiences always a social good? Could aesthetics also inspire violent crime, working-class unrest, and racial murder? To answer these questions, Russ Castronovo turns to those who debated claims that art could democratize culture--civic reformers, anarchists, novelists, civil rights activists, and college professors--to reveal that beauty provides unexpected occasions for radical, even revolutionary, political thinking. <br>""B"eautiful Democracy" explores the intersection of beauty and violence by examining university lectures and course materials on aesthetics from a century ago along with riots, acts of domestic terrorism, magic lantern exhibitions, and other public spectacles. Philosophical aesthetics, realist novels, urban photography, and black periodicals, Castronovo argues, inspired and instigated all sorts of collective social endeavors, from the progressive nature of tenement reform to the horrors of lynching. Discussing Jane Addams, W.E.B. Du Bois, Charlie Chaplin, William Dean Howells, and Riis as aesthetic theorists in the company of Kant and Schiller, "Beautiful Democracy" ultimately suggests that the distance separating academic thinking and popular wisdom about social transformation is narrower than we generally suppose.', 'Art'),

His mantra: Average investors can become experts in their own field and can pick winning stocks as effectively as Wall Street professionals by doing just a little research.<p>Now, in a new introduction written specifically for this edition of One Up on Wall Street, Lynch gives his take on the incredible rise of Internet stocks, as well as a list of twenty winning companies of high-tech ''90s. That many of these winners are low-tech supports his thesis that amateur investors can continue to reap exceptional rewards from mundane, easy-to-understand companies they encounter in their daily lives.<p>Investment opportunities abound for the layperson, Lynch says. By simply observing business developments and taking notice of your immediate world -- from the mall to the workplace -- you can discover potentially successful companies before professional analysts do. This jump on the experts is what produces "tenbaggers", the stocks that appreciate tenfold or more and turn an average stock portfolio into a star performer.<p>The former star manager of Fidelity''s multibillion-dollar Magellan Fund, Lynch reveals how he achieved his spectacular record. Writing with John Rothchild, Lynch offers easy-to-follow directions for sorting out the long shots from the no shots by reviewing a company''s financial statements and by identifying which numbers really count. He explains how to stalk tenbaggers and lays out the guidelines for investing in cyclical, turnaround, and fast-growing companies.<p>Lynch promises that if you ignore the ups and downs of the market and the endless speculation aboutinterest rates, in the long term (anywhere from five to fifteen years) your portfolio will reward you. This advice has proved to be timeless and has made One Up on Wall Street a number-one bestseller. And now this classic is as valuable in the new millennium as ever.', 'Business and Economics'),

The book says that power is inside us too. It says that anyone can harness that power and improve their life, if they are willing to do so.</p>  <p>The Power stresses the importance of positive emotions and attitudes. Everything that the heart desires can happen, if the person is willing to make an effort at changing their attitudes and thoughts.</p>  <p>The life force that is present within everyone can be tuned into when a person feels positive emotions, and looks on their environment, the people around them, and everything else, with appreciation, and a feeling of gratitude for the positive things already present in their life.</p>  <p>This book is not just about how to go after everything you desire and get it. It also advocates the power of other positive emotions, like gratitude. It asks the reader to think of all the things in their life that they are thankful for, and to spend some time appreciating these things. This helps people when they are feeling depressed and helps them see the bright side of their lives.Once this happens, it energizes the person to take positive action in relation any current challenge facing them.</p>  <p>The recurring theme of this book is the power of love, a power that is rejuvenated by positive attitudes and emotions, and itself energizes the person experiencing it towards higher things.</p>  <p>The Power has also been released as an audio CD. It has been translated into many languages like Chinese, Dutch, Hindi, Greek Hebrew, French, Spanish, Russian, and Finnish.</p>  <p><strong>About the Author :</strong></p>  <p><strong>Rhonda Byrne,</strong> born in 1951 in Australia, is an Australian writer.

This volume, a lively reassessment of Greenberg''s writings, features three approaches to the man and his work: Greenberg as critic, doctrinaire, and theorist. The book also features a transcription of a public debate with Greenberg that de Duve organized at the University of Ottawa in 1988. "Clement Greenberg Between the Lines" will be an indispensable resource for students, scholars, and enthusiasts of modern art. "In this compelling study, Thierry de Duve reads Greenberg against the grain of the famous critic''s critics--and sometimes against the grain of the critic himself. By reinterpreting Greenberg''s interpretations of Pollock, Duchamp, and other canonical figures, de Duve establishes new theoretical coordinates by which to understand the uneasy complexities and importance of Greenberg''s practice." John O''Brian, editor of "Clement Greenberg: The Collected Essays and Criticisms" "De Duve is an expert on theoretical aesthetics and thus well suited to reassess the formalist tenets of the late American art critic''s theory on art and culture. . . .

William Davies King, on the other hand, has devoted decades to collecting nothing--and a lot of it. Captivated by the detritus of everyday life, King has spent a lifetime gathering a monumental mass of miscellany, from cereal boxes to boulders to broken folding chairs. Junk, you might call it--and so might King, at times. With "Collections of Nothing," he takes a hard look at this habitual hoarding to see what truths it can reveal about the impulse to accumulate. Part memoir, part reflection on the mania of acquisition, "Collections of Nothing" begins with the stamp collection that King was given as a boy. Philatelism''s long-standing rules governing the care and display of collections soon proved an oppressive burden in the midst of the family chaos generated by his sister''s growing mental illness; choosing to ignore the rules, King began to handle and display his collection according to his own desires--the first step in his search for an unexplored, individual meaning in collecting. In the following years, rather than rarity or pedigree, he found himself searching out the lowly and the lost, the cast-off and the undesired: objects that, merely by gathering and retaining them, he could imbue with meaning, even value. As he relates the story of his burgeoning collections, King also offers a fascinating meditation on the human urge to collect. Whether it''s nondescript loops of wire and old food labels or more commonly prized objects like first editions or baseball cards, our collections define us at least as much as we define them. This wry, funny, even touching appreciation and dissection of the collector''s art as seen through the life of a most unusual specimen will appeal to anyone who has ever felt the unappeasable power of that acquisitive fever.', 'Art'),

The first edition of "Critical Terms for Art History" both mapped and contributed to those transformations, offering a spirited reassessment of the field''s methods and terminology. <br>Art history as a field has kept pace with debates over globalization and other social and political issues in recent years, making a second edition of this book not just timely, but crucial.

For example, Richard Shiff discusses "Originality" in Vija Celmins''s "To Fix the Image in Memory," a work made of eleven pairs of stones, each consisting of one "original" stone and one painted bronze replica. <br>In addition to the twenty-two original essays, this edition includes nine new ones--"performance," "style," "memory/monument," "body," "beauty," "ugliness," "identity," "visual culture/visual studies," and "social history of art"--as well as new introductory material. All help expand the book''s scope while retaining its central goal of stimulating discussion of theoretical issues in art history and making that discussionaccessible to both beginning students and senior scholars. <br>Contributors: Mark Antliff, Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, Stephen Bann, Homi K.

She also challenges the political inertia that results from these conclusions.<p>Day organizes her defense around critics who have engaged substantively with emancipatory thought and social process: T. J. Clark, Manfredo Tafuri, Fredric Jameson, Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, and Hal Foster, among others. She maps the tension between radical dialectics and left nihilism and assesses the interpretation and internalization of negation in art theory. <p>Chapters confront the claim that exchange and equivalence have subsumed the use value of cultural objects& mdash;and with it critical distance& mdash; and interrogate the proposition of completed nihilism and the metropolis put forward in the politics of Italian operaismo. Day covers the debates on symbol and allegory waged within the context of 1980s art and their relation to the writings of Walter Benjamin and Paul de Man. She also examines common conceptions of mediation, totality, negation, and the politics of anticipation.

The first edition of "Critical Terms for Art History" both mapped and contributed to those transformations, offering a spirited reassessment of the field''s methods and terminology. <br>Art history as a field has kept pace with debates over globalization and other social and political issues in recent years, making a second edition of this book not just timely, but crucial. Like its predecessor, this new edition consists of essays that cover a wide variety of "loaded" terms in the history of art, from "sign" to "meaning," "ritual" to "commodity," Each essay explains and comments on a single term, discussing the issues the term raises and putting the term into practice as an interpretive framework for a specific work of art. For example, Richard Shiff discusses "Originality" in Vija Celmins''s "To Fix the Image in Memory," a work made of eleven pairs of stones, each consisting of one "original" stone and one painted bronze replica. <br>In addition to the twenty-two original essays, this edition includes nine new ones--"performance," "style," "memory/monument," "body," "beauty," "ugliness," "identity," "visual culture/visual studies," and "social history of art"--as well as new introductory material. All help expand the book''s scope while retaining its central goal of stimulating discussion of theoretical issues in art history and making that discussionaccessible to both beginning students and senior scholars. <br>Contributors: Mark Antliff, Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, Stephen Bann, Homi K.

The difference, Richard Powell contends, lies in the social capital that stems directly from the black subject''s power to subvert dominant racist representations by evincing such traits as self-composure, self-adornment, and self-imagining. <br> Powell forcefully supports this argument with evidence drawn from a survey of nineteenth-century portraits, in-depth case studies of the postwar fashion model Donyale Luna and the contemporary portraitist Barkley L. Hendricks, and insightful analyses of images created since the late 1970s. Along the way, he discusses major artists--such as Frederic Bazille, John Singer Sargent, James Van Der Zee, and David Hammons--alongside such overlooked producers of black visual culture as the Tonka and Nike corporations. Combining previously unpublished images with scrupulous archival research, "Cutting a Figure" illuminates the ideological nature of the genre and the centrality of race and cultural identity in understanding modern and contemporary portraiture.', 'Art');

Logic is how the mind knows reality, intuition is how the spirit experiences reality. Osho''s discussion of these matters is wonderfully lucid, occasionally funny, and thoroughly engrossing. <br>All people have a natural capacity for intuition, but often social conditioning and formal education work against it. People are taught to ignore their instincts rather than to understand and use them as a foundation for individual growth and development-and in the process they undermine the very roots of the innate wisdom that is meant to flower into intuition. <br>In this volume, Osho pinpoints exactly what intuition is and gives guidelines for how to identify its functioning in others and ourselves. You will learn to distinguish between genuine intuitive insight and the "wishful thinking" that can often lead to mistaken choices and unwanted consequences. Includes many specific exercises and meditations designed to nourish and support each individual''s natural intuitive gifts. <br>OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to experience life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the "1000 Makers of the 20th Century" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people-along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha-who have changed the destiny of India.

If only he had said, ''Thank You''.<br /><br />In September, the month where IIT-ians do distinctly non-IITian things, Samar was having the time of his life. With Rock shows, JAM sessions, debates and politics, his life resembled a colourful graffiti. Adding chaos to this randomness were his three partners-in-crime, Pranav, Skimpy and Jiya. Together they made sure that life was impossibly wild and barely legal.<br /><br />Things hit a crescendo when Samar found himself as the frontrunner in the race for the head of the student body at IIT. And that is when the tide began to turn, in a way Samar could have never imagined. A causal ambition threatened to come true, and threw at Samar dilemmas that would stump any IITian with a pair of glasses.

Meditation: The First and Last Freedom shows that meditation is not a spiritual discipline separate from everyday life in the real world. In essence, it is simply the art of being aware of what is going on inside and around us. As we acquire the knack, meditation can be our companion wherever we are-at work, at play, at rest. Meditation contains practical, step-by-step guides to a wide variety of meditation techniques selected by and/or created by Osho, including the unique OSHO Active Meditations which deal with the special tensions of contemporary life. Recognizing that it''s almost impossible for most people these days just to stop and sit silently, these meditations - including the Osho Dynamic Meditation and Osho Kundalini Meditation - begin with one or more stages of vigorous physical activity. This brings our physical and mental energies to a peak, so that the following silence is easy -- leaving us alert, refreshed, and newly energized.

Osho posits that when our education systems put too much emphasis on developing intellect, an imbalance is created and both the individual and the society suffer. It is only through intelligence that we can respond creatively to the challenges of a changing world. <br />The Insights for a New Way of Living series aims to shine light on beliefs and attitudes that prevent individuals from being their true selves.

Gandhiji Inspired Movements For Freedom Across The World, Especially In Other Parts Of Asia And Africa. Born On 2 October 1869 At Porbandar, Gujarat, He Absorbed Very Early In Life The Experiences That Would Play An Important Role In His Adulthood. The Indian Classics, Especially The Fable Of Raja Harishchandra (Known For His Honesty), Made A Great Impact On The Young Gandhi. In His Schooldays, Gandhi Was An Average Student, And Somehow Managed To Pass His Matriculation Examination. In September 1888, Gandhi Went To London To Be Trained As A Barrister. There, He Interacted With Members Of The Theosophical Society, Where Buddhist And Hindu Literature Was Studied. He Soon Became Interested In Religious Thought And Started To Read The Holy Books Of Hinduism, Christianity And Other Religions.<br /><br />On 30 January 1948, Mahatma Gandhi Was Assassinated By Nathuram Godse, A Hindu Right-Wing Extremist, Who Mistakenly Believed That Gandhiji Was Responsible For The Partition Of The Country.

Never really present in what we are doing, never fully alert to our environment, and not even aware of what motivates us to do and say the things we do. <br />At the same time, all of us have experienced moments of awareness-or awakening, to use another-in extraordinary circumstances. On the road, in a sudden and unexpected accident, time seems to stop and one is suddenly aware of every movement, every sound, every thought. Or in moments that touch us deeply-welcoming a new baby into the world for the first time, or being with someone at the moment of death. <br />Awareness, says Osho, is the key to being self-directed, centered, and free in every aspect of our lives. In this book, Osho teaches how to live life more attentively, mindfully, and meditatively, with love, caring and consciousness. <br />OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the "1000 Makers of the 20th Century" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people-along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha-who have changed the destiny of India.

This anthology, which will be of vital interest to anyone involved in this era, includes not only fiction, poetry, and drama, but also essays, treatises, literary criticism, comic poetry, adaptations from Chinese, folk stories and other non-canonical works. Many of these texts have never been translated into English before, and several classics have been newly translated for this collection.<p> "Early Modern Japanese Literature" introduces English readers to an unprecedented range of prose fiction genres, including dangibon (satiric sermons), kibytshi (satiric and didactic picture books), sharebon (books of wit and fashion), yomihon (reading books), kokkeibon (books of humor), gtkan (bound books), and ninjtbon (books of romance and sentiment). The anthology also offers a rich array of poetry -- waka, haiku, senry{, kytka, kytshi -- and eleven plays, which range from contemporary domestic drama to historical plays and from early puppet theater to nineteenth century kabuki. Since much of early modern Japanese literature is highly allusive and often elliptical, this anthology features introductions and commentary that provide the critical context for appreciating this diverse and fascinating body of texts.<p>One of the major characteristics of early modern Japanese literature is that almost all of the popular fiction was amply illustrated by wood-block prints, creating an extensive text-image phenomenon. In some genres such as kibytshi and gtkan the text in fact appearedinside the woodblock image. Woodblock prints of actors were also an important aspect of the culture of kabuki drama. A major feature of this anthology is the inclusion of over 200 woodblock prints that accompanied the original texts and drama.', 'Art'),

Falling in love (and out of love) with statues, George Hersey reveals here, has been an instrumental practice since antiquity in our efforts to understand, improve, and empower ourselves. <br> Hersey''s history of statue love begins in Cyprus, home of the legendary sculptor Pygmalion, who famously grew enamored of his own creation. Examining the island''s prehistoric images of Aphrodite--the love goddess who brought Pygmalion''s sculpture to life--Hersey traces the origins of statue love back to the Cypriot followers who adored her terra-cotta likenesses. He goes on to explore ideas about human replicas in the works of Empedocles, Aristotle, Lucretius, and Ovid, whose definitive account of the Pygmalion myth introduced the notion that statues have the potential to induce physical responses in their viewers. Finding avatars of Ovid''s living image in everything from pagan idols and early Christian statuary to eighteenth-century painting to modern action figures and marionettes, Hersey concludes by investigating the concern that these automata will eventually replace humans.<br> In the process, he narrates a powerful history of artificial life at a moment when--with the development of robot soldiers, ever more sophisticated genetic engineering, and a continually expanding digital universe--it seems more real than ever.', 'Art'),

These two hundred years also witnessed the production of luxurious artworks made of gold, ivory, alabaster, and faience--objects that helped to foster good relations among the kingdoms. In fact, as Marian H. Feldman makes clear here, art and international relations during the Late Bronze Age formed an unprecedented symbiosis, in concert with expanded travel and written communications across the Mediterranean. And thus diplomacy was invigorated through the exchange of lavish art objects and luxury goods, which shared a repertoire of imagery that modern scholars have called the first International Style in the history of art. <br>Previous studies have focused almost exclusively on stylistic attribution of these objects at the expense of social contextualization. Feldman''s "Diplomacy by Design" instead examines the profound connection between art produced during this period and its social and political contexts, revealing inanimate objects as catalysts--or even participants--in human dynamics. Feldman''s fascinating study shows the ways in which the diplomatic circulation of these works actively mediated and strengthened political relations, intercultural interactions, and economic negotiations and she does so through diverse disciplinary frameworks including art history, anthropology, and social history.

Henry VIII is on the throne, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is his chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. Into this atmosphere of distrust and need comes Thomas Cromwell, first as Wolsey''s clerk, and later his successor. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events. Ruthless in pursuit of his own interests, he is as ambitious in his wider politics as he is for himself. His reforming agenda is carried out in the grip of a self-interested parliament and a king who fluctuates between romantic passions and murderous rages. From one of our finest living writers, Wolf Hall is that very rare thing: a truly great English novel, one that explores the intersection of individual psychology and wider politics. With a vast array of characters, and richly overflowing with incident, it peels back history to show us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself with great passion and suffering and courage.</p><br/><br/>From The Washington Post''s Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Wendy Smith Henry VIII''s quest to make Anne Boleyn his queen has inspired reams of historical fiction, much of it trashy and most of it trite. Yet from this seemingly shopworn material, Hilary Mantel has created a novel both fresh and finely wrought: a brilliant portrait of a society in the throes of disorienting change, anchored by a penetrating character study of Henry''s formidable adviser, Thomas Cromwell. It''s no wonder that her masterful book won the Man Booker Prize last week. Mantel''s choice of protagonist signals her intelligence and artistic ambition. Cromwell was the quintessential 16th-century New Man, the son of a blacksmith who rose through Cardinal Wolsey''s patronage and survived the cardinal''s downfall to become the most powerful civil servant in Tudor England. Historians have long acknowledged Cromwell as the administrative genius who transformed a medieval fiefdom into a modern nation-state, but only an exceedingly bold novelist could envision this odyssey as the stuff of gripping fiction. From the moment we see young Thomas knocked to the ground by his brutal father to the grim final scene at the execution of his enemy Thomas More in 1535, readers are intimately engaged in Cromwell''s emotions and calculations. Mantel puts us inside the head of this secretive, complicated man, illuminating motives often misunderstood by others. Convincing Henry that only he can deliver the marriage and the absolute authority the king wants is a means to an end; Cromwell intends to make England a better place for the common people among whom he was born by destroying the corrupt Catholic clergy he despises and limiting the power of the entrenched aristocrats who despise him. He plans to get very rich along the way. Cromwell understands this better than anyone else in the novel. He observes, evaluates and makes his moves, but never shows his hand. He''s a committed, albeit covert Protestant who runs uncharacteristic risks to protect the new movement''s more militant adherents from the heretic-burning More (acidly depicted as a cruel, sanctimonious egomaniac nothing like the saintly hero of ''A Man for All Seasons''). But Cromwell realizes that Henry, who would happily remain Catholic if the pope would just give him what he wants, can only be led to the Reformation through his desire for Anne Boleyn. And though Cromwell respects Anne, a fellow upstart on the make, he''s not staking his career on her ability to arrest the king''s roving eye. ''Any little girl can hold the key to the future,'' he thinks as he chats with mousy young lady-in-waiting Jane Seymour. The Seymour family estate, Wolf Hall, gives the novel its title; the scandalous goings-on there -- Jane''s father has been caught in flagrante with his son''s wife -- serve as a metaphor for the licentious, overprivileged society through which Cromwell adroitly maneuvers. Alone among the self-absorbed plotters at Henry''s court, he sees that this society is increasingly irrelevant. Listening to a disgruntled earl pontificate about ''ancient rights,'' Cromwell wonders how he can explain real life to this clueless nobleman. ''The world is not run from where he thinks. Not from his border fortresses, not even from Whitehall. The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from places he has never imagined . . . not from castle walls, but from countinghouses, not by the call of a bugle but by the click of the abacus.'' Cromwell belongs to this rising global order; he''s been a wool trader in Antwerp and a banker in Florence, as well as a foot soldier in some continental army and a cook in an Italian kitchen. Sophisticated yet down-to-earth, he''s not intimidated by England''s insular elite, though he recognizes the power it holds. If Anne has a son and Henry lives another 20 years to bequeath the crown to an adult heir, he reckons, ''I can build my own prince: to the glorification of God and the commonwealth of England.'' That doesn''t happen, of course, though resourceful Cromwell survives Elizabeth''s birth and climbs still higher as the indispensable facilitator of Henry''s schemes. Yet even readers unaware that he fell from favor and was executed as a traitor in 1540 -- five years beyond the novel''s close and never hinted at in the text -- will sense that Cromwell''s success can''t last. The bleakly knowing veteran of poverty, prejudice and loss delineated here surely senses it, too. A fiercely loyal friend, determined protector of kin, mentor of sharp young plebeians wherever he finds them, Cromwell nonetheless takes it as a given that ''man is wolf to man.'' Mantel has explored this uncomfortable idea in previous works, discerning no more kindness among the contemporary characters in ''Vacant Possession'' or ''Beyond Black'' than among the 18th-century combatants in ''The Giant, O''Brien'' or ''A Place of Greater Safety.'' Like these predecessors, ''Wolf Hall'' is uncompromising and unsentimental, though alert readers will detect an underlying strain of gruff tenderness. Similarly, Mantel''s prose is as plain as her protagonist (who''s sensitive about his looks), but also (like Cromwell) extraordinarily flexible, subtle and shrewd. Enfolding cogent insights into the human soul within a lucid analysis of the social, economic and personal interactions that drive political developments, Mantel has built on her previous impressive achievements to write her best novel yet.<br/>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Victor Margolin, cofounder and an editor of the journal "Design Issues," and Richard Buchanan, also an editor of the journal, bring together eleven essays by scholars in fields ranging from psychology, sociology, and political theory to technology studies, rhetoric, and philosophy. The essayists share the editors'' concern, first made clear in Margolin''s "Design Discourse: History, Theory, Criticism," with the the development of design studies as a field of interdisciplinary research. <br>The contributors (Gianfranco Zaccai, Albert Borgmann, Richard Buchanan, Augusto Morello, Tufan Orel, Nigel Cross, Victor Margolin, Langdon Winner, Carl Mitcham, Tony Fry, and Ezio Manzini) focus on three broad themes that form a sequence of fundamental issues: how to shape design as a subject matter, how to distinguish the activity of designing in the complex world of action, and how to address the basic questions of value and responsibility that persistently arise in the discussion and practice of design. The editors'' introduction provides a useful overview of these questions and offers a multidisciplinary framework for design studies. The essays discuss such topics as the relation of aesthetics to technology, the place of design in social action, the role of the consumer in design decisions, and the need for ethical practice in contemporary design. Manzini''s concluding essay shows how the issue of ethics should connect responsible behavior to decisions made every day in the manufacture ofobjects.', 'Art'),

While many of the greatest modern painters and architects have insisted on the spiritual significance of their work, historians of modern art and architecture have largely avoided questions of religion. Likewise, contemporary philosophers and theologians have, for the most part, ignored the visual arts. Taylor presents a carefully structured and subtly nuanced analysis of the religious presuppositions that inform recent artistic theory and practice - and, in so doing, recasts the cultural landscape of our era. For Taylor, twentieth-century art and architecture fall into three epochs: modernism and two contrasting views of postmodernism. He shows how we can understand these epochs through multiple senses of "disfiguring". While abstract painting and high modern architecture disfigure, in the sense of removing designs, symbols, and ornaments, pop art and postmodern architecture disfigure this austere purity with playful images. Taylor uncovers a more profound kind of disfiguring in the subversive postmodernism of "deconstructive" architects such as Peter Eisenman and painters such as Anselm Kiefer. These artists attempt to figure the unfigurable, Taylor argues, and so create the possibility of refiguring the sacred for our postmodern age. Taylor''s larger purpose in Disfiguring is constructive or, perhaps more accurately, reconstructive. By exploring the religious dimensions of twentieth-century painting and architecture, he shows how the visual arts continue to serve as a rich resource for the theological imagination.', 'Art'),

Warren Cohen portrays the assembling of the great American collections of East Asian art, public and private, and the idiosyncrasies of the collectors. Particular attention is focused on how this art became part of the cultural consciousness of the people of the United States, transforming their culture into something more complex than the Western civilization their ancestors brought from Europe. Cohen tells of art collectors, dealers, and historians, of museums and their curators, of art and imperialism, art and politics, art as an instrument of foreign policy. One of America''s leading diplomatic historians, Cohen views art as an important part of international relations. He describes the use of art in "cultural diplomacy" to implement policy by China, Japan, and the United States. He argues that "virtually every act in the movement of art between cultures has political implications". The book demonstrates how art collecting interacts with the shifting rhythms of international politics and the business cycle. The recent decline in American economic power, with Japan emerging preeminent, was first obvious in the art world where American collectors found themselves unable to compete with their Japanese and Hong Kong counterparts and watched great works begin to move back across the Pacific.', 'Art'),

During this period, female members of the powerful Medici family governed the city for the first and only time in its history. These women also helped shape the city''s artistic life, commissioning works of music, art, and theater that were inscribed with their own concerns and aspirations. "Echoes of Women''s Voices" examines the patronage of individuals and institutions, particularly convents, which have remained, until now, largely neglected by scholars. <br>Through commissions, patrons sought to promote a vision of the world and their place in it. The unique social norms, laws, educational backgrounds, and life experiences of female patrons meant the expression of a worldview that differed significantly from that of their male counterparts. Joining exceptional archival research with telling analysis of significant examples of music, art, and drama, Kelley Harness challenges the prevailing view that Florence saw a political and artistic decline during this period. She argues convincingly that the female domination of these years brought forth artistic patronage that was both continuous and well-conceived.<br>', 'Art');

From marble busts to intricately painted vases, these antiquities were amassed in vast collections held in country houses and libraries throughout Britain. In "Fabricating the Antique," Viccy Coltman examines these objects and their owners, as well as dealers, restorers, designers, and manufacturers. She provides a close look at the classical revival that resulted in this obsession with collecting antiques. <br>Looking at the theoretical foundations of neoclassicism, Coltman contends this reinvention of ancient material culture was more than a fabrication of style. Based in the strong emphasis on classical education during this time, neoclassicism, Coltman claims, could be more accurately described as a style of thought translated into material possessions. "Fabricating the Antique" is a new take on both well-known collections of ancient art and newly cataloged artifacts. This book also covers how these objects--once removed from their original context--were received, preserved, and displayed.

In more traditional cultures, however, such objects as pictures, effigies, and buildings were valued not as much for their chronological age as for their perceived links to the remote origins of religions, nations, monasteries, and families. As a result, Christopher Wood argues, premodern Germans tended not to distinguish between older buildings and their newer replacements, or between ancient icons and more recent forgeries. <br> But Wood shows that over the course of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, emerging replication technologies--such as woodcut, copper engraving, and movable type--altered the relationship between artifacts and time. Mechanization highlighted the artifice, materials, and individual authorship necessary to create an object, calling into question the replica''s ability to represent a history that was not its own. Meanwhile, print catalyzed the new discipline of archaeological scholarship, which began to draw sharp distinctions between true and false claims about the past. Ultimately, as forged replicas lost their value as historical evidence, they found a new identity as the intentionally fictional image-making we have come to understand as art.', 'Art'),

Among other topics, Dubbini explores how the descriptive and pictorial techniques used in mariners'' charts, view-oriented atlases, military cartography, and garden design were linked to the proliferation of highly realistic paintings of landscapes and city scenes; how the "picturesque" system for defining and composing landscapes affected not just art but also archaeology and engineering; and how the ever-changing modern cityscapes inspired new ways of seeing and representing the urban scene in Impressionist painting, photography, and stereoscopy.

However, over the past two centuries, this proposition first put forth by Adam Smith has been taken out of context, contorted, and used as the cornerstone of free-market orthodoxy.</p>  <p>In <em>Beyond the Invisible Hand</em>, Kaushik Basu lays bare the implications of this gross misrepresentation of Smith&rsquo;s theory which, he argues, has resulted in hampering our understanding of how economies function, why some economies fail and some succeed, and what the nature and role of state intervention might be. Comparing this view of the invisible hand to the vision described by Kafka&mdash;in which individuals pursuing their atomistic interests, devoid of moral compunction, end up creating a world that is mean and miserable&mdash;Basu calls for collective action and the need to shift our focus from the efficient society to one that is also fair.</p>  <p>As Basu pointedly reminds us, by ignoring the role of culture and custom, traditional economics promotes the view that the current system is the only viable one, thereby only serving the interests of those who do well by this system. <em>Beyond the Invisible Hand</em> challenges readers to fundamentally rethink the assumptions underlying modern economic thought and proves that a more equitable society is both possible and sustainable, and hence worth striving for.</p>', 'Business and Economics'),

A complicated artist and thinker, Inness painted stunningly beautiful, evocative views of the American countryside. Less interested in representing the details of a particular place than in rendering the "subjective mystery of nature," Inness believed that capturing the spirit or essence of a natural scene could point to a reality beyond the physical or, as Inness put it, "the reality of the unseen." <br>Throughout his career, Inness struggled to make visible what was invisible to the human eye by combining a deep interest in nineteenth-century scientific inquiry--including optics, psychology, physiology, and mathematics--with an idiosyncratic brand of mysticism. Rachael Ziady DeLue''s "George Inness and the Science of Landscape"--the first in-depth examination of Inness''s career to appear in several decades--demonstrates how the artistic, spiritual, and scientific aspects of Inness''s art found expression in his masterful landscapes. In fact, Inness''s practice was not merely shaped by his preoccupation with the nature and limits of human perception; he conceived of his labor as a science in its own right. <br>This lavishly illustrated work reveals Inness as profoundly invested in the science and philosophy of his time and illuminates the complex manner in which the fields of art and science intersected in nineteenth-century America. Long-awaited, this reevaluation of one of the major figures of nineteenth-century American art will prove to be a seminal text in the fields of art history and American studies.', 'Art'),

With examples from Hollywood, Bollywood, French grand opera, Latin American television, West African music, postcolonial literature, and even the Thai sex trade, Singh cites not only the attempt to address cultural discomfort but also the effort to deny entertainment acts as cultural. He connects creative expression to clashes between national identities, and he details the effect of cultural policies, such as institutional patronage and economic incentives, on the making and incorporation of art into the global market.

Traditionally, in India, the attainment of 60 years, called shashti-poorti, is an important milestone in the life of an individual. It is a time to reflect on one''s past and start planning for the future. <br/> <br/> This volume brings together a brilliant posse of writers, including academicians, journalists and activists, who took up the challenge of such stocktaking, of assessing the achievements and failures of these six decades across a range of issues and concerns. The result is a lively collection of essays that examine the problems, solutions and debates which move contemporary India. From democracy, elections, agriculture, economy, education, human rights and reservations - areas where no single voice or solution seems to be the answer - to literature, art, cinema and urban life - where the eye cannot keep pace with the flashing images - writers range at will, differing from one another in tone and opinion, but allied in the clarity and sharpness of their perspective. <br/> <br/> Dipankar Gupta discusses the imperatives of democracy in the context of reservations; Lord Meghnad Desai writes on the course that the Indian economy has charted over the past 60 years; Sudhir Kakar summarizes for us the paradoxes of the Indian family; Kanti Bajpai sets out the parameters of changing Indo-US relations; Sir Mark Tully reflects on the transformation of broadcasting technology and content; Dayanita Singh frames space and emotion in a series of speaking images of a society in transition while Pankaj Mishra writes with characteristic ease and insight on the death of the small town. <br/> <br/> A thoughtful compendium of elegantly presented arguments supported by facts and, more importantly, a real understanding of the way things work in this country of a billion ideas, India 60 is a must-read for all those who seek to know India.

The costs of production, materials, and labor have nothing to do with fixing its price.

How, then, do the many artists, collectors, dealers, and curators whose lives and livelihoods are so intimately affected by the valuation of art manage to cope with such an intangible market? To answer this question, Stuart Plattner eschews the spotlights and media-hype of glitzy New York galleries, and focuses instead upon the more localized, and much more typical, world of the St. Louis art scene. What emerges is the most comprehensive description ever published of a contemporary regional avant-garde center, where noble aesthetic ambitions compete with the exigencies of economic survival. Plattner''s skillful use of in-depth interviews enables the market''s key participants to speak for themselves, giving voice to the many frustrations and rewards, motivations and constraints that influence their interactions with their work, the market, and each other. Ultimately it becomes clear that, in various and diverse ways, they are all tacitly invested - psychologically, economically, and socially - in the mystification of value of the work of art. With refreshing realism and honesty, Plattner develops a finely textured and sympathetic portrait of a unique kind of economic community, one whose very existence is staked on the paradox of art as commodity.<br>How do artists, collectors, dealers, and curators whose lives and livelihoods are so intimately affected by the valuation of art manage to cope with such an intangible market? <br>To answer this question, Stuart Plattner eschews the spotlights and media-hype of glitzy New York galleries, and focuses instead upon the more localized, and much more typical, world of the St. Louis art scene.

In this innovative and engrossing business parable, harry Paul and Ross Reck show managers at all levels how they can immediately and easily increase productivity by tapping into the discretionary effort of the people who work for them. Starting from the most basic aspect of business reality - that people intentionally regulate the amount of effort they put into their jobs based upon how they feel they&rsquo;re being treated - authors point out that the most important part of the job of every manager, team leader, supervisor and executive is to treat people in such a way that they become excited about applying all their discretionary effort toward performing their jobs. At the book&rsquo;s center is the story of Nancy Kim, a human resources director at a magazine that is struggling with all the problems associated with unhappy employees - low productivity and morale along with high absenteeism and turnover. After she openly challenges the CEO&rsquo;s new management-by-the-numbers system, she&rsquo;s charged with turning the situation around immediately.

Music, visual images, words written on paper and photographs also have an impact on the crystal structure. Emoto theorizes that since water has the ability to receive a wide range of frequencies, it can also reflect the universe in this manner. He found that water from clear springs and water exposed to loving words shows brilliant, complex, and colorful snowflake patterns, while polluted water and water exposed to negative thoughts forms incomplete, asymmetrical patterns with dull colors.

But there has been a growing and unfortunate tendency to equate buzz words, motivational slogans and financial goals with "strategy". Richard Rumelt debunks these elements of "bad strategy"</p>  <p>and awakens an understanding of the power of "good strategy." A good strategy is a specific and coherent response to the obstacles to progress. It works by harnessing and applying power where it will have the greatest effect, whether putting a man on the moon, fighting a war or launching a new product. Rumelt argues that the heart of good strategy is insight into the hidden power in a situation, and into an appropriate response and he shows how this insight can be cultivated.</p>  <p>Good Strategy/Bad Strategy draws on business, non-profit and military affairs to bring Rumelt"s original and pragmatic ideas to life. His fascinating examples range from Apple to General Motors; from the two Iraq wars to Afghanistan; from a small local market to Walmart and from Global Crossing to the 2007-08 financial crisis.</p>  <p>Demonstrating an astonishing grasp and deft integration of economics, finance, technology, history, and the brilliance and foibles of the human character, Good Strategy/Bad Strategy is the culmination of Rumelt"s decades of striving beyond the superficial to address hard questions with honesty, clarity and integrity.</p>  <p><strong>About the Author :</strong></p>  <p><strong>Richard Rumelt</strong> is one of the world"s most influential thinkers on strategy and management.

In the first book of its kind, Halle gives a fascinating account of the uses and meaning of art for those who buy it and live with it. His study ranges from the affluent town houses on Manhattan''s Upper East Side and row houses in blue-collar Brooklyn to middle- and upper-middle class suburbs on Long Island, resulting in an unprecedented portrait of the meanings of art for its primary audience. Are there differences in artistic preferences between social classes or races or between urban and suburban homes? Similarities? How do choices in art works - and the way we display them - speak to our dreams, desires, pleasures, and fears? And what do they say about the real cultural boundaries between elite and popular, high and low? Halle examines landscapes, both priceless heirlooms and mass-produced sunsets; abstract paintings and prints; "primitive" sculpture; and the vibrantly colored portraits of religious art. He also discusses the gatherings of family photographs that fill every home. Inside Culture also explores the architecture and design of the houses, from the eclipse of the formal dining room to the landscape of urban backyards. Refusing easy generalizations about culture and class, Halle shows that art has a different set of meanings outside the rarefied air of museums and galleries. He challenges received opinion about the role of the audience in the history and reception of twentieth-century art to show that the experience of art isn''t always what artistsand critics say it is. With floor plans, drawings, and dozens of photographs, this lively book can be enjoyed on many levels. It describes for the first time the way a broad cross section of people live with art. It records for the first time the astonishing variety of artistic experience. And it permanently changes our ongoing conversation about what culture contains, what it controls, and what the products called "art" really mean.<br>Dubbed as "You Are What You Hang (or Don''t)" by the "New York "<br>"Times," "Inside Culture" takes us on a tour of 160 homes in and <br>around New York City, from affluent townhouses on Manhattan''s Upper East <br>Side and rowhouses in blue-collar Brooklyn to middle and upper-class <br>suburbs of Long Island. The result is an unprecedented portrait of the <br>use of cultural artifacts--fine art, photographs, religious art--in <br>private lives. <br>"This is a first-class addition to what we know about culture in the <br>specific rather than the abstract."--Howard S. Becker, "Contemporary "<br>"Sociology" <br>"This book is well worth reading, especially in your own home."--Eugene <br>Halton, "American Journal of Sociology" <br>"David Halle''s researches earned him a license amateur voyeurs would <br>kill for. . . .

Whether sculpting a head of state, an intellectual, or a young child, Houdon had an uncanny ability to capture the essence of his subject with a characteristic pose or expression. Yet until now, Houdon''s exquisite sculptures have never been the subject of a major exhibition. <br>This lavish exhibition catalogue will immediately take its rightful place as the definitive work on Houdon. With more than one hundred color plates and two hundred black and white halftones, "Jean-Antoine Houdon: Sculptor of the Enlightenment "illustrates every stage of the sculptor''s fascinating career, from his early portrayals of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette to his stunning portraits of American patriots such as George Washington, the Marquis de Lafayette, John Paul Jones, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson. Indeed the images we hold dear of legendary Enlightenment figures like Diderot, Rousseau, d''Alembert, and Voltaire are based on works by Houdon. More than mere representations, these sculptures provide us fascinating, intimate glimpses into the very core of who these figures were. Houdon''s genius animated even his less illustrious subjects, like his portraits of his family and friends, and filled his sculptures of children with delicacy and freshness. Accompanying the images of Houdon''s masterworks are four insightful essays that discuss Houdon''s views on art (based in part on a newly discovered manuscript written by the artist) as well as his prominencein the highly varied cultures of eighteenth-century France, Germany, and Russia. <br>From aristocrats to revolutionaries, actors to philosophers, Houdon''s amazingly vivid portraits constitute the visual record of the Enlightenment and capture the true spirit of a remarkable age. "Jean-Antoine Houdon" finally gives these gorgeous works their due.', 'Art'),

It forcefully reminds us that a reader is never neutral, that is, dead; never impartial, that is, utopian, or no place.<br>In 1990 the Department of Graphic Arts at the Louvre made their holdings available to guest curators for a program called "Parti Pris," or "Taking Sides." In this program, major cultural figures outside of the discipline of art history organized exhibitions based on the department''s collection.

In his exhibition and accompanying essay, Starobinski explores the theme of largesse in its broadest sense. Arguing that gift giving and receiving are fundamental human gestures, he examines graphic and textual representations from the offering of the apple to Eve to Salome''s gift of the head of John the Baptist, from the giving of laws to the gift of death. Charity, the poetic gift, and the benefits of Fortune all play a role in Starobinski''s extended meditation on the act of donation.

From the moment that the prior there complained to Leonardo that the work was taking too long, the" Last Supper" has endured centuries of controversy, neglect, and difficulty. "Leonardo, The Last Supper," translated from the Italian, is the definitive document of the recently completed project to reverse these centuries of decline by restoring the painting to close to its initial state and preserving it in a manner that generations of conservators have failed to do. <br>The technical problems with the "Last Supper" began as soon as Leonardo started to paint it. He jettisoned the traditional fresco technique of applying paint to wet plaster, a method unsuited to Leonardo''s slow and thorough execution, and created the work instead with an experimental technique that involved painting directly on the dry plaster. Rather than creating a durable surface in which the pigment and the plaster dry and cohere together, he applied an oil tempera of questionable composition to the surface of the dry plaster, causing the paint to flake immediately. With this renegade method, Leonardo rendered one of the most enduring painting techniques volatile and unstable. <br>The fortunes of the "Last Supper" continued to suffer after its completion; it was repainted no fewer than four times over the course of the centuries. Leonardo may have been the first to attempt to restore it in 1517; this effort was followed by two further interventions in the eighteenth century and another in the nineteenth century. "The LastSupper" has withstood food fights in the refectory staged by Napoleonic soldiers; it survived Allied bombs in 1943, although the rest of the refectory was nearly destroyed. With centuries of additional damage caused by age, tourists, candle smoke, grease from the refectory, and pollution, the "Last Supper" was in desperate need of a complete restoration. <br>Pinin Brambilla Barcilon was chosen to head this twenty-year project, and "Leonardo, The Last Supper" is the official record of her remarkable effort. It first documents the cleaning and removal of the overpainting performed in the other attempts at restoration and then turns to Barcilon''s meticulous additions in watercolor, which were based on Leonardo''s preparatory drawings, early copies of the painting, and contemporary textual descriptions. This book presents full-scale reproductions of details from the fresco that clearly display and distinguish Leonardo''s hand from that of the restorer. With nearly 400 sumptuous color reproductions, the most comprehensive technical documentation of the project by Barcilon, and an introductory essay by art historian and project codirector Pietro C. Marani that focuses on the history of the fresco, "Leonardo, The Last Supper" is the definitive chronicle of one of the most extensive restoration projects ever attempted. <br>Naturally of great interest to Italian Renaissance art historians and scholars, "Leonardo, The Last Supper" should also be considered an essential volume to anyone who appreciates the splendor, beauty, and technical achievements of Renaissance painting. It is both an invaluable historic record and an extraordinarily handsome volume.', 'Art'),

The faithful believed that these images, through their likeness to the person represented, became a tangible presence of the Holy and were able to work miracles, deliver oracles, and bring victory on the battlefield. In this magisterial book, one of the world''s leading scholars of medieval art traces the long history of the image and its changing role in European culture. Belting''s study of the iconic portrait opens in late antiquity, when Christianity reversed its original ban on images, adapted the cult images of the "pagans", and began developing an iconography of its own. The heart of the work focuses on the Middle Ages, both East and West, when images of God and the saints underwent many significant changes either as icons or as statues. The final section of Likeness and Presence surveys the Reformation and Renaissance periods, when new attitudes toward images inaugurated what Belting calls the "era of art" that continues to the present day - an era during which the aesthetic quality has become the dominant aspect of the image. Belting neither "explains" images nor pretends that images explain themselves. Rather, he works from the conviction that images reveal their meaning best by their use. Likeness and Presence deals with the beliefs, superstitions, hopes, and fears that come into play as people handle and respond to sacred images. Recognizing the tensions between image and word inherent in religion, Belting includes in an appendix many important historical documents that relate to the history and use of images.

But at the same time, there arises an undercurrent of feeling that something is missing-a quality of intimacy. <br />This quality has very little to do with the physical, though sex is certainly one possible door. Far more important is a willingness to expose our deepest feelings and vulnerabilities, with the trust that the other person will treat them with care. Ultimately, the willingness to take the risk of intimacy has to be grounded in an inner strength that knows that even if the other remains closed, even if that trust is betrayed, we will not suffer any permanent damage. <br />In this gentle and compassionate guide, Osho takes his readers step-by-step through what makes people afraid of intimacy, how to encounter those fears and go beyond them, and what they can do to nourish themselves and their relationships to support more openness and trust. <br />OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to life in all its richness.

A voluminous correspondent, Courbet himself, through his letters, offers a tantalizing avenue toward a keener assessment of his character and accomplishments. In her critical edition of over six hundred of the artist''s letters, Petra ten-Doesschate Chu presents just such a look at the inner life of the artist; her unparalleled feat of gathering together all of Courbet''s known letters, many heretofore unpublished and untranslated, is sure to change our evaluation of Courbet''s creativity and of his place in nineteenth-century French life. Beginning when Courbet left his provincial home at eighteen and ending eight days before his death in exile in Switzerland, this correspondence enables readers to follow the artist''s development from youth to mature artist of international repute. Addressed to such varied and key figures of the Second Empire and the early Third Republic as Charles Baudelaire, Alfred Bruyas, Max Buchon, Champfleury, Pierre Dupont, Theophile Gautier, Victor Hugo, Claude Monet, the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Jules Simon, Jules Valles, and Francis Wey, Courbet''s letters offer numerous insights into the artist''s private and public personae, his work, and his participation in the cultural and political life of his day. They will encourage a rethinking of fixed notions about Courbet while they help to form a more nuanced picture of the artist''s marketing strategies, his relation to the contemporary media, his deliberate choice of subject matter for Salon paintings, hispreoccupation with photography, and his reasons for participating in the Commune. The correspondence is also important for a better understanding of Courbet''s work. The letters reveal that the artist produced an uninterrupted flow of portraits of family and friends, work unaccounted for today that appears to be as crucial to the development of Courbet''s art as his larger, better-known paintings. Petra ten-Doesschate Chu, a recognized expert on nineteenth-century French art, has spent over ten years collecting, translating, and annotating these letters. Along with her annotations, she has provided this edition with an introduction, a detailed chronology, short biographies of Courbet''s correspondents and persons appearing frequently in the letters, a list of paintings and sculptures mentioned in the letters, and an inventory of the letters and their whereabouts. The result is an invaluable cultural resource, as useful as it is readable, as illuminating as it is entertaining.', 'Art'),

He points out that "passion" lies at the root of the word, and then proceeds to challenge assumptions about what compassion really is. Many so-called acts of compassion, he says, are tainted by a subtle sense of self-importance and desire for recognition. Others are based in the desire not really to help others but to force them to change. Using stories from the lives of Jesus and Buddha and the world of Zen, Osho shows how the path to authentic compassion arises from within, beginning with a deep acceptance and love of oneself. Only then, says Osho, does compassion flower into a healing force, rooted in the unconditional acceptance of the other as he or she is. <br />"Compassion" includes an original, 120-minute talk by Osho on DVD. This visual component enables the reader to experience the direct wisdom and humor of Osho straight from the source.

Offering a radically different view of these supposedly savage soldiers, "Mekong Diaries" presents never-before-published drawings, poems, letters, and oral histories by ten of the most celebrated Viet Cong war artists. <br> These guerrilla artists--some military officers and some civilians--lived clandestinely with the fighters, moving camp alongside them, going on reconnaissance missions, and carrying their sketchbooks, ink, and watercolors into combat. Trained by professors from the Hanoi Institute of Fine Arts who journeyed down the perilous Ho Chi Minh Trail to ensure a pictorial history of the war, they recorded battles and events from Operation Junction City to Khe Sanh to the Tet Offensive. They also sketched as the spirit moved them, rendering breathtaking landscapes, hut and bunker interiors, activities at base camps, troops on the move, portraits for the families of fallen soldiers, and the unimaginable devastation that the conflict left in its wake. <br> Their collective record--which Sherry Buchanan skillfully compiles here--is an extraordinary historical and artistic document of people at war. As such, it serves as a powerful response to the self-centeredness of American accounts of Vietnam, filling a profound gap in our national memory by taking us into the misunderstood worlds of those whom we once counted among our worst enemies.', 'Art'),

Selected by Derrida from the prints <br>and drawings department of the Louvre, the works depict <br>blindness--fictional, historical, and biblical. From Old <br>and New Testament scenes to the myth of Perseus and the <br>Gorgon and the blinding of Polyphemus, Derrida uncovers in <br>these images rich, provocative layers of interpretation. <br>For Derrida drawing is itself blind; as an act rooted in <br>memory and anticipation, drawing necessarily replaces one <br>kind of seeing (direct) with another (mediated). Ultimately, <br>he explains, the very lines which compose any drawing are <br>themselves never fully visible to the viewer since they exist <br>only in a tenuous state of multiple identities: as marks on <br>a page, as indicators of a contour. Lacking a "pure" <br>identity, the lines of a drawing summon the supplement of the <br>word, of verbal discourse, and, in doing so, obscure the <br>visual experience. Consequently, Derrida demonstrates, the <br>very act of depicting a blind person undertakes multiple <br>enactments and statements of blindness and sight. <br>"Memoirs of the Blind" is both a sophisticated <br>philosophical argument and a series of detailed readings. <br>Derrida provides compelling insights into famous and lesser <br>known works, interweaving analyses of texts--including <br>Diderot''s "Lettres sur les aveugles," the notion of <br>mnemonic art in Baudelaire''s "The Painter of Modern "<br>"Life," and Merleau-Ponty''s "The Visible and the"<br>"Invisible," Along with engaging meditations on the history <br>and philosophy of art, Derrida reveals the ways viewers <br>approach philosophical ideas through art, and the ways art <br>enriches philosophical reflection. <br>An exploration of sight, representation, and art, <br>"Memoirs of the Blind" extends and deepens the <br>meditation on vision and painting presented in "Truth and "<br>"Painting," Readers of Derrida, both new and familiar, will <br>profit from this powerful contribution to the study of the <br>visual arts.', 'Art'),

Its contents and associations evoke social issues without being reducible to any one of them. Here, literary critic and theorist Mieke Bal presents the work as a theoretical object, one that can teach us how to think, speak, and write about art. <br>Known for her commentary on the issue of temporality in art, Bal argues that art must be understood in relationship to the present time of viewing as opposed to the less-immediate contexts of what has preceded the viewing, such as the historical past of influences and art movements, biography and interpretation. In ten short chapters, or "takes," Bal demonstrates that the closer the engagement with the work of art, the more adequate the result of the analysis. She also confronts issues of biography and autobiography--key themes in Bourgeois''s work--and evaluates the consequences of "ahistorical" experiences for art criticism, drawing on diverse sources such as Bernini and Benjamin, Homer and Eisenstein. <br>This short, beautiful book offers both a theoretical model for analyzing art "out of context" and a meditation on a key work by one of the most engaging artists of our era.', 'Art'),

From Ford Motor''s first assembly line in 1913 to the New York World''s Fair in 1939, Smith traces the distinctive visual imagery that evolved as the core of American modernity in the first half of the twentieth century. Illustrated with an extraordinary variety of photographs, many previously unpublished, Making the Modern focuses on the key images of modernity - industry and workers, cities and crowds, and products and consumers - as portrayed across the broad spectrum of American experience. Albert Kahn''s plant designs, Charles Sheeler''s industrial landscapes, Margaret Bourke White''s photographs, Diego Rivera''s Detroit murals, the design of Fortune magazine, advertising, the FSA historical project - all are cited here in a brilliant synthesis of visual imagery and historical interpretation. Smith reveals how this visual revolution played an instrumental role in the complex psychological, social, economic, and technological changes that came to be known as the second industrial revolution. From the role of visualization in the invention of the assembly line, to office and building design, to the corporate and lifestyle images that filled new magazines such as Life and Fortune, he traces the extent to which the second wave of industrialization engaged the visual arts to project a new iconology of progress. Employing a wide rage of disciplines - including history of technology, business, design, art, advertising, andarchitecture - Smith provides fresh readings of an array of topics including: the nostalgic desire for the past as an essential part of modernity; Frida Kahlo''s feminist resistance to masculinist modernization; the popularity of industrial design; the Chicago and New York expositions as consumerist utopias. This broad, challenging work advances our understanding not only of twentieth-century art and design, but also of a crucial period in the history of modern culture.', 'Art'),

They are approximately ages 0 through 5, although some members of the first wave of Crystal Children are as old as 7. These children are like Indigos--highly psychic and sensitive--but without the dark edge and the anger energy. <br /> The term "Crystal Children "is already taking hold worldwide, and people everywhere are talking about these special kids. Since Doreen is the only researcher who is publicly giving speeches on the subject, her audiences have been asking her for a book on the topic. It''s a natural sequel to her book "The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children." <br /> As babies, Crystal Children may take longer than normal to begin talking. They are highly telepathic, and their tuned-in mothers communicate with them nonverbally. Because they''re so sensitive, the Crystal Children babies may fuss and cry a lot in crowded places. They''re also very fond of nature. Doreen once watched one Crystal Child walk from tree to tree, giving each one a big hug. <br /> Crystal Children are beautiful inside and out, like magnificent little high-priests and priestesses. One look in their eyes, and you''ll recognize Divine love and wisdom. Their auras are bright, radiant, and opalescent--they seem to glow from the inside They talk about past lives, distant galaxies, and profound insights concerning peace and love. Most Crystal Children''s parents are aware that their kids are special, and they''re thrilled to be parenting such delightful children. <br /> The book includes many interviews with Crystal Children, their parents, and teachers. It discusses parenting and teaching methods that are essentialto keeping these children happy and healthy, and how to avoid pitfalls that could spoil their special gifts. The book ties in to a Website called www.crystal-children.com that Doreen is preparing--an Internet site for Crystal Children and their parents where they can post messages and read relevant articles. </p>', 'Body, Mind and Spirit'),

Greenstein draws on Early Renaissance art theory, modern narratology, translation studies, critical theory, the philosophy of history, and biblical hermeneutics to explicate the sense and significance of one of Andrea Mantegna''s most enigmatic and influential works, the Uffizi Circumcision of Christ. Faced with a work that resists established methods of iconographical analysis, Greenstein reassesses the nature and goals of high humanist narrative painting. The result is a new, historically grounded theory of iconography that calls into question many widely held assumptions about the social and intellectual value of Early Renaissance art. Greenstein''s theory rests on a careful analysis of Leon Battista Alberti''s commentary On Painting, which equated both the form and the content of artistically composed painting with historia. Situating this equation within a centuries-old discourse on the multivalent significance of the Bible, Greenstein shows that, for Alberti, historia was a mode of artistic narrative, common to literature and painting, in which moral truths were presented to the corporeal senses, particularly to vision, in the guise of plausible human actions. In Greenstein''s reading, the painter''s primary task was the construction of a visually plausible narrative that effectively conveyed the higher meanings of historia. Having thus delineated the structure of significance in Albertian painting, Greenstein shows what was at stake when a painter of Mantegna''s historical bent undertook to produce a historia. As one of the leading historical thinkers of his age, Mantegna imbued his depicted scenes with the plausibility of historical events by employing thosecodes of evidence, causality, and historical distance that underlay the Renaissance sense of the past. But the Circumcision of Christ resisted such treatment because the symbolic conventions developed by earlier artists for conveying the higher theological meanings of the theme were incompatible with the representational fidelity embraced by painters of historia. Mantegna overcame these difficulties by arriving at a new understanding of the Circumcision, which remained faithful to the narrative structure as well as the theological content of the biblical account. His interpretation was widely adopted by later artists, but was so pictorial in nature that, despite its consistency with the biblical account, it remained with-out parallel in theological literature. Greenstein''s discovery--that artistic production of Albertian painting was a specialized and singularly visual form of thinking whose roots lay more in readerly hermeneutics than in perception, commerce, or common visual experience--raises questions about narrative, representation, and the textuality of art that will interest a wide array of scholars.<br>In this extraordinary explication of one of the most enigmatic and influential works of the Renaissance, the Uffizi "Circumcision of Christ," Jack M. Greenstein reassesses the nature and goals of high humanist narrative painting. <br>"Greenstein has raised the level of sophistication of the historical criticism of Renaissance painting by at least one whole notch; at the same time, he has written a book for everyone interested in problems of interpretation."--David Summers, University of Virginia<br>', 'Art'),

While opinions of Rockwell vary from uncritical admiration to sneering contempt, those who love him and those who dismiss him do agree on one thing: his art embodies a distinctively American style of innocence. <br>In this sure-to-be controversial book, Richard Halpern argues that this sense of innocence arises from our reluctance--and also Rockwell''s--to acknowledge the often disturbing dimensions of his works. Rockwell''s paintings frequently teem with perverse acts of voyeurism and desire but contrive to keep these acts invisible--or rather, hidden in plain sight, available for unacknowledged pleasure but easily denied by the viewer. <br>Rockwell emerges in this book, then, as a deviously brilliant artist, a remorseless diagnostician of the innocence in which we bathe ourselves, and a continuing, unexpected influence on contemporary artists. Far from a banal painter of the ordinary, Halpern argues, Rockwell is someone we have not yet dared to see for the complex creature he is: a wholesome pervert, a knowing innocent, and a kitschy genius. <br>Provocative but judicious, witty but deeply informed, "Norman Rockwell" is a book rich in suggestive propositions and eye-opening details--one that will change forever the way we think about this American icon and his works. <p>', 'Art'),

Kaplan and Norton demonstrate how senior executives in industries such as banking, oil, insurance, and retailing are using the Balanced Scorecard both to guide current performance and to target future performance. They show how to use measures in four categories - financial performance, customer knowledge, internal business processes, and learning and growth - to align individual, organizational, and cross-departmental initiatives and to identify entirely new processes for meeting customer and shareholder objectives. The authors also reveal how to use the Balanced Scorecard as a robust learning system for testing, gaining feedback on, and updating the organization''s strategy. Finally, they walk through the steps that managers in any company can use to build their own Balanced Scorecard. The Balanced Scorecard provides the management system for companies to invest in the long term - in customers, in employees, in new product development, and in systems - rather than managing the bottom line to pump up short-term earnings.

Japanese scholar-artists delved deep into Chinese painting, calligraphy, literature, and religion -- often measuring their own achievements against those of their Chinese counterparts on the mainland -- while simultaneously cultivating native Japanese poetic and calligraphic forms. Kodojin, the "Old Taoist" (1865-1944), was the last of these great poet-painters in Japan. Under the support of various patrons, he composed a number of Taoist-influenced Chinese and Japanese poems and did lively and delightful ink paintings, continuing the tradition of the poet-sage who devotes himself to study of the ancients, lives quietly and modestly, and creates art primarily for himself and his friends. Kodojin cultivated this artistic ideal in Meiji and post-Meiji Japan -- an era very different from that of the Tokugawa, which had provided a much more hospitable environment for the age-old literati aesthetic. Kodojin''s reliance upon the values of a literati lifestyle met many challenges as Japan transformed itself into an industrial and militarized nation, but he wavered neither in his personal behavior nor in his art.<p>Portraying this last representative of a tradition of gentle and refined artistry in the midst of a society that valued economic growth and national achievement above all, this beautifully illustrated book brings together 150 of Kodojin''s Chinese poems (introduced and translated by Jonathan Chaves), more than 100 of his haiku and tanka (introduced and translated by Stephen Addiss), and many examples of his calligraphy and ink paintings. Addiss''s in-depth introductiondetails the importance of the poet-painter tradition, outlines the life of Kodojin, and offers a critical appraisal of his work, while J. Thomas Rimer''s essay puts the work of the Old Taoist in context. By thus introducing English-language readers to the evocative work of the last of the great Japanese literati poet-painters, Old Taoist helps fulfill the wish expressed by Kodojin himself in one of his poems: <p>Year after year I send out these "elegant orchids" hoping the subtle perfume may be preserved.', 'Art'),

Kodjin, the "Old Taoist" (1865-1944), was the last of these great poet-painters in Japan. Under the support of various patrons, he composed a number of Taoist-influenced Chinese and Japanese poems and did lively and delightful ink paintings, continuing the tradition of the poet-sage who devotes himself to study of the ancients, lives quietly and modestly, and creates art primarily for himself and his friends.<p>Portraying this last representative of a tradition of gentle and refined artistry in the midst of a society that valued economic growth and national achievement above all, this beautifully illustrated book brings together 150 of Kodjin''s Chinese poems (introduced and translated by Jonathan Chaves), more than 100 of his haiku and tanka (introduced and translated by Stephen Addiss), and many examples of his calligraphy and ink paintings. Addiss''s in-depth introduction details the importance of the poet-painter tradition, outlines the life of Kodjin, and offers a critical appraisal of his work, while J. Thomas Rimer''s essay puts the literary work of the Old Taoist in context.', 'Art'),

At the heart of all human experience lies our obsession with death.

Such ideas went on to have both trivial and terrible effects: from a sweeping craze of seances to the mass-murders of the Stalinist terror. Gray raises vital questions about the ''truths'' science can offer, the technology we are still exploiting for immortality - and exactly what it means to be human.</p>', 'Body, Mind and Spirit'),

Bellow. Strauss. Friedman. The University of Chicago has been the home of some of the most important thinkers of the modern age. But perhaps no name has been spoken with more respect than Turabian. The dissertation secretary at Chicago for decades, Kate Turabian literally wrote the book on the successful completion and submission of the student paper. Her "Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations," created from her years of experience with research projects across all fields, has sold more than seven million copies since it was first published in 1937. <br>Now, with this seventh edition, Turabian''s "Manual "has undergone its most extensive revision, ensuring that it will remain the most valuable handbook for writers at every level--from first-year undergraduates, to dissertation writers apprehensively submitting final manuscripts, to senior scholars who may be old hands at research and writing but less familiar with new media citation styles. Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams, and the late Wayne C. Booth--the gifted team behind "The Craft of Research"--and the University of Chicago Press Editorial Staff combined their wide-ranging expertise to remake this classic resource. They preserve Turabian''s clear and practical advice while fully embracing the new modes of research, writing, and source citation brought about by the age of the Internet. <br>Booth, Colomb, and Williams significantly expand the scope of previous editions by creating a guide, generous in length and tone, to the art of research and writing. Growing out of the authors'' best-selling "Craft of Research," this new section provides students with an overview of every step of the researchand writing process, from formulating the right questions to reading critically to building arguments and revising drafts. This leads naturally to the second part of the "Manual for Writers," which offers an authoritative overview of citation practices in scholarly writing, as well as detailed information on the two main citation styles ("notes-bibliography" and "author-date"). This section has been fully revised to reflect the recommendations of the fifteenth edition of "The Chicago Manual of Style "and to present an expanded array of source types and updated examples, including guidance on citing electronic sources. <br>The final section of the book treats issues of style--the details that go into making a strong paper. Here writers will find advice on a wide range of topics, including punctuation, table formatting, and use of quotations. The appendix draws together everything writers need to know about formatting research papers, theses, and dissertations and preparing them for submission. This material has been thoroughly vetted by dissertation officials at colleges and universities across the country. <br>This seventh edition of Turabian''s "Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations" is a classic reference revised for a new age.

Created for those of lesser standing, these works contrast sharply with those made for imperial patrons, illustrious monastics, or other luminaries. They were often modest in scale, mass-produced, and at times incomplete. These "ordinary images" have been considered a largely nebulous, undistinguished mass of works because they cannot be related to well-known historical figures or social groups. Additionally, in a time and place where most inhabitants were not literate, the available textual evidence provides us with a remarkable view of China through the eyes of a small and privileged educated class. There exists precious little written material that embodies the concerns and voices of those of lower standing. <br>Situating his study in the gaps between conventional categories such as Buddhism, Daoism, and Chinese popular imagery, Abe examines works that were commissioned by patrons of modest standing in specific local contexts. These works include some of the earliest known examples of Buddha-like images in China; a group of small stone stupas from the northwest; inscribed image niches from a cavernous Buddhist cave temple; and large stele with Buddhist, Daoist, and mixed Buddhist-Daoist iconography from Shaanxi province. In these four case studies, Abe questions established notions of art historical practice by treating the works in a manner that allows for more rather than less contradiction, less rather than more certainty. Sensitive to the fragmentary nature of the evidence and hisposition in a long tradition of scholarly writing, the author offers a sustained argument against established paradigms of cultural adaptation and formal development. <br>Sophisticated and lucidly written," Ordinary Images" offers an unprecedented exploration of the lively and diverse nature of image making and popular practices.<br>This richly illustrated book explores the large body of sculpture, paintings, and other religious imagery produced for China''s common classes from the third to the sixth centuries C.E.

It governs the relationship of daubs of pigment on a canvas to reality, allowing the viewer to connect with the imagined world of a work of art. Charles Harrison''s latest endeavor, "Painting the Difference," explores the role of the picture plane in modern painting and the relationships it creates among the artist, the subject, and the spectator. One of the most respected teachers and theorists of modern art, Harrison here offers a bold interpretation of the Modernist canon that uncovers the significance of gender to the functioning of the picture plane. <p>Arguing that the representation of women in art was crucial to the character of modernity, Harrison traces the history of female subjects as they began to gaze out of the picture to confront and engage their viewers. Combining sweeping conceptual history with telling investigations into the details of particular paintings, "Painting the Difference" deciphers the implications of sexual difference for the development of nineteenth- and twentieth-century art. Harrison shows how artists, reflecting the underlying anxieties of the time about gender, used female subjects'' gazes both to create a sexualized relationship between these subjects and their viewers and to simultaneously question that relationship. In considering works by artists such as Renoir, Manet, Degas, Cezanne, Picasso, and Matisse, as well as Rothko, Warhol, Cindy Sherman, and many more, Harrison incorporates elements of cultural criticism and social history into his argument. Generous color illustrations permit the reader to test Harrison''s claims against the works on which they are based.

Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with "networking." He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them: <br>Don''t keep score: It''s never simply about getting what you want.

Here, on a white--not a high--horse, Susan Bielstein offers her decades of experience as an editor working with illustrated books. In doing so, she unsnarls the threads of permissions that have ensnared scholars, critics, and artists for years. <br>Organized as a series of "takes" that range from short sidebars to extended discussions, "Permissions, A Survival Guide" explores intellectual property law as it pertains to visual imagery. How can you determine whether an artwork is copyrighted? How do you procure a high-quality reproduction of an image? What does "fair use" really mean? Is it ever legitimate to use the work of an artist without permission? Bielstein discusses the many uncertainties that plague writers who work with images in this highly visual age, and she does so based on her years navigating precisely these issues. As an editor who has hired a photographer to shoot an incredibly obscure work in the Italian mountains (a plan that backfired hilariously), who has tried to reason with artists'' estates in languages she doesn''t speak, and who has spent her time in the archival trenches, she offers a snappy and humane guide to this difficult terrain. <br>Filled with anecdotes, asides, and real courage, "Permissions, A Survival Guide" is a unique handbook that anyone working in thevisual arts will find invaluable, if not indispensable.', 'Art'),

Most important, this innovative guide shows the reader how to avoid "hot trends" that will land them in hot water, as well as other devastating mistakes commonly made by investors.<br>David Dreman''s name is synonymous with the term "contrarian investing," and his contrarian strategies have been proven winners year after year. His techniques have spawned countless imitators, most of whom pay lip service to the buzzword "contrarian," but few can match his performance. His Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund has been the leader since its inception in 1988 -- the number one equity-income fund among all 208 ranked by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. Dreman is also one of a handful of money managers whose clients have beaten the runaway market over the past five, ten, and fifteen years.<p>Now, as the longest bull market in the history of the stock market winds down, there is increasing volatility and a great deal of uncertainty. This is the climate that tests the mettle of the pros, the worries of the average investor, and the success of David Dreman''s brilliant new strategies for the next millennium.<p>"Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation" shows investors how to outperform professional money managers and profit from potential Wall Street panics -- all in Dreman''s trademark style, which "The New York Times" calls "witty and clear as a silver bell." Dreman reveals a proven, systematic, and safe way to beat the market by buying stocks of good companies when they are currently out of favor. At the heart of his book is a fundamental psychological insight: investors overreact. Dreman demonstrates how investors consistently overvalue the so-called "best" stocks and undervalue the so-called "worst" stocks, and how earnings and other surprises affect the best and worst stocks in opposite ways. Since surprises are a way of life in the market, Dreman shows you how toprofit from these surprises with his ingenious new techniques, most of which have been developed in the nineties. You''ll learn: <p> <li>Why contrarian stocks offer extra protection in bear markets, as well as delivering superior returns when the bull roars.<p> <li>Why a high dividend yield is just as important for the aggressive investor as it is for "widows and orphans."<p> <li>Why owning Treasury bills and government bonds -- the "safest investments" for centuries -- is like being fully margined at the top of the 1929 market.<p> <li>Why Initial Public Offerings are a guaranteed loser''s game.<p> <li>Why you should avoid Nasdaq ("the market of the next hundred years") like the plague.<p> <li>Why crisis, panic, and even market downturns are the contrarian investor''s best friend.<p> <li>Why the chances of hitting a home run using the Street''s best research are worse than being the big winner in the New York State Lottery.<p></UL><p>Based on cutting-edge research and irrefutable statistics, David Dreman''s revolutionary techniques will benefit professionals and laymen alike.<p>', 'Business and Economics');

As Hollis Clayson demonstrates in "Paris in Despair," the siege took an especially heavy toll on the city''s artists, forcing them out of the spaces and routines of their insular prewar lives and thrusting them onto the ramparts (as many became soldiers). <br>But the crisis did not halt artistic production, as some have suggested. In fact, Clayson argues that the siege actually encouraged innovation, fostering changed attitudes and new approaches to representation among a wide variety of artists as they made art out of their individual experiences of adversity and change--art that has not previously been considered within the context of the siege. Clayson focuses especially on Rosa Bonheur, Edgar Degas, Jean-Alexandre-Joseph Falguiere, Edouard Manet, and Henri Regnault, but she also covers a host of other artists, including Ernest Barrias, Gustave Courbet, Edouard Detaille, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Albert Robida, and James Tissot. "Paris in Despair" includes more than two hundred color and black-and-white images of works by these artists and others, many never before published. <br>Using the visual arts as an interpretive lens, Clayson illuminates the wide range of issues at play during the siege and thereafter, including questions of political and cultural identity, artistic masculinity and femininity, public versus private space, everyday life and modernity, and gender and class roles in military and civilian society. For anyone concerned with these issues, or with nineteenth-century French art in general, "Paris inDespair" will be a landmark work.', 'Art'),

Steiner then takes up this history at the point where the Renaissance system was breaking down.<br>How do pictures tell stories? Why does the literary romance so often refer to paintings and other visual art objects? Beginning with these two seemingly unrelated questions, Wendy Steiner reveals an intricate exchange between the visual arts and the literary romance. <br>Romances violate the casual, temporal, and logical cohesiveness of realist novels, and they do so in part by depicting love as a state of suspension, a condition outside of time. Steiner argues that because Renaissance and post-Renaissance painting also represents a suspended moment of perception with "unnatural" clarity and compression of meaning, it readily serves the romance as a symbol of antirealism. Yet the atemporality of stopped-action painting was actually an attempt to achieve pictorial realism2;the way things "really" look. It is this paradox that interests Steiner: to signal their departure from realism, romances evoke the symbol of "realistic" visual artwork. Steiner explores this problem through analyses of Keats, Hawthorne, Joyce, and Picasso. She then examines a return to narrative conventions in visual art in the twentieth century, in the work of Lichtenstein and Warhol, and speculates on the fate of pictorial storytelling and the romance in postmodern art. An aesthetic fantasia of sorts, this study combines theory and analysis to illuminate an unexpected interconnection between literature and the visual arts. <br>', 'Art'),

Paying particular attention to the participation of Camille Pissarro, the only older artist to join the otherwise youthful movement, Ward sets the neo-impressionists'' individual achievements in the context of a generational struggle to redefine the purposes of painting. She describes the conditions of display, distribution, and interpretation that the neo-impressionist challenged, and explains how these artists sought to circulate their own work outside of the prevailing system. Throughout, there are sensitive discussions of such artists as Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, as well as Pissarro. Yet the touchstone of the book is Pissarro''s intricate relationship to the various factions of the Paris art world. Pissarro''s adoption of neo-impressionism, often considered an aberrant move, was in fact consistent with a larger pattern of rupture and discontinuity in his career, and a sign of his responsiveness to the changing social connotations of artistic language. In close readings of selected paintings, Ward shows how Pissarro''s neo-impressionist works express his anxieties over the institutional and commercial developments of art, simultaneously addressing and seeking to alter their own historical position.<br>Martha Ward tracks the development and reception of neo-impressionism, revealing how the artists and critics of the French art world of the 1880s and 1890s created painting''s first modern vanguard movement. <br>Paying particular attention to the participation of Camille Pissarro, the only older artist to join the otherwise youthful movement, Ward sets the neo-impressionists'' individual achievements in the context of a generational struggle to redefine the purposes of painting.

How other countries have treated American prisoners also says much about the standing of the United States in the world. Throughout U.S. history, prisoners of war have functioned as symbols of outrage and patriotism, as figures of pity, power, triumph, and fealty, ultimately illustrating the human impact of war.<p>Retelling the story of America through its prisoners and involvement in international law, Stephanie Carvin explores America''s inherent difficulty of being both exceptional and secure. While American diplomats negotiate a treaty at The Hague, for example, American soldiers suppress a bloody insurrection, throwing themselves into a conflict in which no rules apply. Carvin''s argument is not that the relationship among America, its prisoners, and international law is founded entirely on exceptional culture and carnage. Rather, she identifies a blend of ideology, national imperative, and historical inevitability that has challenged American presidents from Washington to Obama. Her research shows that, despite the claim that America faces a unique and unprecedented battle in its "war on terror," the roots of this conflict lie in the history of those who have been captured in war. By contextualizing these stories within America''s larger historical narrative, Carvin achieves a richer understanding of modern warfare.', 'Art'),

"True leadership," he informs us, "is only possible when character is more important than authority."<br>Marshall III draws inspiration from three names that have resonated powerfully throughout history to develop his unique concept of leadership: Sitting Bull, Red Cloud, and, especially Crazy Horse, whose fascinating life Marshall already chronicled in a biography that "Publishers Weekly" praised as "vivid and haunting."

Four factors stand out when looking at him as a leader, and they were the basis of his success: <br>"Know yourself. Know your friends. Know the enemy. Lead the way." "The Power of Four" shows how and why these maxims--and this Native American philosophy of leadership--is not only applicable to today''s world, but desperately needed: why leadership by example is more powerful than authority; and why the selection of leaders also becomes one way of controlling those very same leaders.

For each word or expression, Holder includes examples from real authors, along with entertaining explanations of the words origins and meaning. Thus we learn that "bite the bullet" (to make a<br>difficult decision) comes from the fact that soldiers, being flogged, were once given a bullet to bite down on, and "Stool Pigeon" (an informant) comes from the practice of tying a pigeon to a stool to lure other pigeons to capture.<br> New to this edition are over 250 new entries and fourteen introductory articles on major themes in euphemistic language, such as business, sex, death, and the human body.

To do this she analyzes the productive relationship between Caravaggio and a number of late-twentieth-century artists who "quote" the baroque master in their own works. Examining this idea in light of pieces by contemporary artists such as Andres Serrano, Carrie Mae Weems, Ken Aptekar, David Reed, and Ana Medieta, Bal shows particular ways in which quotation is vital to the new art but also to the source from which it is derived. <br>"Quoting Caravaggio" is a rigorous, rewarding work that is at once a meditation on creative history and Caravaggio as well as a brilliant critical exposition of current artistic representation and practice.<br>As period, as style, as sensibility, the Baroque remains elusive, its definition subject to dispute. Perhaps this is so in part because baroque vision resists separation of mind and body, form and matter, line and color, image and discourse. In "Quoting Caravaggio," Mieke Bal deploys this insight of entanglement as a form of art analysis, exploring its consequences for both contemporary and historical art, as well as for current conceptions of history. <br>Mieke Bals primary object of investigation in "Quoting Caravaggio" is not the great seventeenth-century painter, but rather the issue of temporality in art. In order to retheorize linear notions of influence in cultural production, Bal analyzes the productive relationship between Caravaggio and a number of late-twentieth-century artists who "quote" the baroque master in their own works. These artists include Andres Serrano, Carrie Mae Weems, Ken Aptekar, David Reed, and Ana Mendieta, among others. Each chapter of "Quoting Caravaggio" shows particular ways in which quotation is vital to the new art but also to the source from which it is derived. Through such dialogue between present and past, Bal argues for a notion of "preposterous history" where works that appear chronologically first operate as an aftereffect caused by the images of subsequent artists. <br>"Quoting Caravaggio" is a rigorous, rewarding work: it is at once a meditation on history as creative, nonlinear process; a study of the work of Caravaggio and the Baroque; and, not least, a brilliant critical exposition of contemporary artistic representation and practice.', 'Art'),

From his book we learn the meaning of dress from head to toe."--Richard Bushman, Columbia University <br>"Ready-Made Democracy" explores the history of men''s dress in America to consider how capitalism and democracy emerged at the center of American life during the century between the Revolution and the Civil War. Michael Zakim demonstrates how clothing initially attained a significant place in the American political imagination on the eve of Independence. At a time when household production was a popular expression of civic virtue, homespun clothing was widely regarded as a reflection of America''s most cherished republican values: simplicity, industriousness, frugality, and independence. <br>By the early nineteenth century, homespun began to disappear from the American material landscape. Exhortations of industry and modesty, however, remained a common fixture of public life. In fact, they found expression in the form of the business suit. Here, Zakim traces the evolution of homespun clothing into its ostensible opposite--the woolen coats, vests, and pantaloons that were "ready-made" for sale and wear across the country. In doing so, he demonstrates how traditional notions of work and property actually helped give birth to the modern industrial order. For Zakim, the history of men''s dress in America mirrored this transformation of the nation''s social and material landscape: profit-seeking in newly expanded markets, organizing a waged labor system in the city, shopping at"single-prices," and standardizing a business persona. <br>In illuminating the critical links between politics, economics, and fashion in antebellum America, "Ready-Made Democracy" will prove essential to anyone interested in the history of the United States and in the creation of modern culture in general.<br>"Ready-Made Democracy" explores the history of men''s dress in America to consider how capitalism and democracy emerged at the center of social life during the century between the Revolution and the Civil War. The story begins with the elevation of homespun clothing to a political ideology on the eve of Independence. Homespun clothing tied the productive efforts of the household to those of the nation, becoming a most tangible expression of the citizen''s attachment to the public''s happiness. <br>Coarse dress did not long remain in the wardrobe, particularly not among those political classes who talked most about it. Nevertheless, exhortations of industry and simplicity became a fixture of American discourse over the following century of industrial revolution, as the mass-produced suit emerged as a badge of a uniquely virtuous American polity. It is here, Zakim argues, in the evolution of homespun into its ready-made opposite, that men''s dress proves to be both material and metaphor for the rise of democratic capitalism--and a site of the new social arrangements of bourgeois life. <br>In thus illuminating the critical links among culture, ideology, political economy, and fashion in antebellum America, "Ready-Made Democracy" will be essential to anyone interested in the history of the United States and the construction of modern life.', 'Art'),

Taking into account art, scenography, music, poetry, and literature, Harbison uncovers currents and connections that transcend the geographical and chronological boundaries commonly imposed on the style. He explores the metamorphoses of Baroque ideas and works of art into later styles, particularly the Rococo, and then, in an unexpected twist, pursues the Baroque idea into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

One of history''s greatest artists, we are often told, had a special affinity for Judaism. With so many of Rembrandt''s works devoted to stories of the Hebrew Bible, and with his apparent penchant for Jewish themes and the sympathetic portrayal of Jewish faces, it is no wonder that the myth has endured for centuries. <br>"Rembrandt''s Jews" puts this myth to the test as it examines both the legend and the reality of Rembrandt''s relationship to Jews and Judaism. In his elegantly written and engrossing tour of Jewish Amsterdam--which begins in 1653 as workers are repairing Rembrandt''s Portuguese-Jewish neighbor''s house and completely disrupting the artist''s life and livelihood--Steven Nadler tells us the stories of the artist''s portraits of Jewish sitters, of his mundane and often contentious dealings with his neighbors in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam, and of the tolerant setting that city provided for Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews fleeing persecution in other parts of Europe. As Nadler shows, Rembrandt was only one of a number of prominent seventeenth-century Dutch painters and draftsmen who found inspiration in Jewish subjects. Looking at other artists, such as the landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael and Emmanuel de Witte, a celebrated painter of architectural interiors, Nadler is able to build a deep and complex account of the remarkable relationship between Dutch and Jewish cultures in the period, evidenced in the dispassionate, even ordinary ways in which Jews and their religion are represented--far from the demonization and grotesque caricatures, the iconography of the outsider, so often found in depictionsof Jews during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. <br>Through his close look at paintings, etchings, and drawings; in his discussion of intellectual and social life during the Dutch Golden Age; and even through his own travels in pursuit of his subject, Nadler takes the reader through Jewish Amsterdam then and now--a trip that, under ever--threatening Dutch skies, is full of colorful and eccentric personalities, fiery debates, and magnificent art.', 'Art'),

The Tofflers explain that we are becoming a nation of "prosumers," consuming what we ourselves produce, and argue that we have all taken on "third jobs"--work we unwittingly do without pay for some of the biggest corporations in the country.

Painted during a difficult time in the artist''s life--when he no longer enjoyed a ready market for his works and may have turned to his deep religious convictions for solace--these images are among the most evocative Rembrandt created. For years scholars have debated whether these paintings were intended as a series, yet until now these works have, unbelievably, never been shown together. <br>An exhibition by the National Gallery of Art and this accompanying catalog assemble seventeen of the paintings for the first time, finally giving the powerful images their due. Many of these subtle and wondrous paintings have been identified as images of apostles and evangelists, but among them are also representations of Christ, the Virgin, and still-unidentified saints and monks. In Rembrandt''s typical fashion, the men and women in these portraits peer out of the dark recesses of dimly lit interiors as though burdened by the weight of their spiritual and emotional concerns. Yet recent archival research has raised questions about their attribution, the relationships among the paintings, and, in a broader sense, Rembrandt''s life and career--issues addressed by the contributors to this volume.

Richly illustrated with pieces spanning his career - including twenty-one color platesthe book also includes never-before-published photographs of the artist himself. Mary Ann Caws discusses the artist''s paintings, drawings, and collages in relation to the wide variety of American and European literature and philosophy Motherwell saw as central to his art. In a progression of critical meditations, Caws looks closely at series of his works, such as In Plato''s Cave and Night Music, and at such great individual pieces as Gift, her inquiry gracefully encompassing the writings of Frost, Baudelaire, Mallarme, Kierkegaard, Stevens, and Garcia Lorca. Her reflections are grounded in an essential agreement with Motherwell that his work was a continuum: that his life and art were a matter of process, journey, and becoming, shaped by a willingness to experiment and to start over. Always returning to the uniquely American themes of openness and possibility in the artist''s work, Caws explores Motherwell''s use of series, his bold color combinations representing such complex issues as solitude and death, and the idea of giving and receiving seen in his technique of collage. The book concludes with five thoughtful interviews between Caws and Motherwell, published here for the first time, featuring discussions of the artist''s relationship to surrealism, to Joseph Cornell, and to Mallarme. Infused with the special knowledge derived from a personal communion with Robert Motherwell''s art, Mary Ann Caw''s work will be an immeasurable source of discoveryfor lovers of both art and literature.', 'Art'),

For centuries, we have relied on this definition to help us determine who is capable and who is not, often assuming that the person with the most professional characteristics is the best one for the job.<br /><br />But every day we see examples of so-called professionals who do more harm than good. However, all of these people had the qualities necessary to do their jobs well, but instead they chose to abuse and corrupt their professions for their own personal gain.<br /><br />So how can we weed out the best from the worst when the accepted standards are no longer enough, and when even the most powerful and respected among us cannot be trusted to behave responsibly or ethically? According to Subroto Bagchi, the first step is to redefine what it means to be a professional. Today, it takes more than just aptitude&mdash;it takes a commitment to doing what&rsquo;s right, not only for your business, but for society as a whole. In a world where patients, clients, and customers can no longer completely trust the advice given to them, The Professional outlines the explicit and implicit code of conduct.<br /><br /><strong>About the Author :</strong><br /><br />Subroto Bagchi is Vice Chairman and Co-founder of MindTree Ltd., a global information technology and research and development consulting company.

These lectures, acclaimed for the verve and freshness with which Schapiro delivered them, languished unpublished for decades. But Linda Seidel, who knew Schapiro well and attended the 1967 lectures, has now expertly transcribed and edited them, presenting them for the first time to an audience beyond the halls of Harvard. <br>In editing the lectures, Seidel closely followed the recordings of the originals.

Here, analyzing in depth both the content and context of Van Mander''s Schilder-Boeck (or Book on Picturing), Walter S. Melion reveals its central importance to an understanding of northern Renaissance and Baroque art. Melion considers the paintings and drawings of the Flemish artist and humanist, showing how they engage the concerns of the Schilder-Boeck. He argues that Van Mander painted the kinds of subject - landscape, still-life, history - sanctioned by his text, implementing pictorial practices he endorsed. Chief among Van Mander''s concerns was the establishment of a canon of early Netherlandish masters. Melion shows how he pursued this goal by first dismantling Vasari''s claims for the supremacy of Tuscan vernacular painting and diction and then drawing on the humanist discourse of Ortelius and his circle to define regional pictorial idioms. By interpreting the terminology employed in the Schilder-Boeck, Melion clarifies the text''s relationship to past and contemporary art theory. Van Mander is seen here developing his critical categories and then applying them to Ancient, Italian, and Netherlandish artists in order to mark changes within a culture and to characterize excellence for each region. Thus Melion demonstrates how Van Mander revised both the structure and critical language of Vasari''s Lives to clarify northern artistic traditions and the concerns of Netherlandish artists. A much needed corrective to the view that Dutchart of the period was lacking in theory, Melion''s work offers a compelling account of a sixteenth- and seventeenth-century theoretical and critical perspective and shows how this perspective suggests a rereading of northern art.<br>A treatise on Dutch art on par with Vasari''s critical history <br>of Italian art, Karel van Mander''s "Schilder-Boeck" (or <br>Book on Picturing) has long been recognized for its critical <br>and historical influence--and yet, until now, no <br>comprehensive account of the book''s conception, aims, and <br>impact has been available.

That, as well as the actual appearance of the speaker-also named Ursula-at her bedside one dark and cold night. The woman who revealed herself to James was Ursula Sontheil, known as Mother Shipton, a sixteenth-century prophetess, healer, and-some say- witch. Legend has it that Mother Shipton was burned by the king''s men for her heresies, and her spirit became trapped in a cave in Yorkshire. This cave had an unusual characteristic: Anything taken there was turned to stone by the action of the lime-suffused waters from a nearby well. Mother Shipton used this water&nbsp; to create an image of herself on the wall, and then split the cave open to call the needy. Sickat heart or in body, people came to her in the cave to offer her objects in return for her healing powers.<br /><br />In The Source, Ursula James describes how Mother Shipton appeared before her with urgent new prophecies for our troubled times- prophecies that include spells for, as Kabbalah says, Tikkun Olam-the healing of the world.

The ubiquitous high-gloss fashion ad. The fraught relationship between artist and critic. "Sleeping Beauty" ties these disparate strands of our everyday lives together only to strip away everything we thought we knew about each of them. A collaborative work by the artist John Sparagana and the critic Mieke Bal, this truly cutting-edge work takes the shape of a conversation between his creations--distressed, or "fatigued," magazine pages--and her words, imagining anew the relationships of image to text and of art to those who write about it.<br> Bal contributes twenty-six essays, one for each letter of the alphabet, which borrow their organizing principle from the dictionary but reach far beyond the utilitarian purpose of a reference volume. Each one enters deeply into Sparagana''s work, illuminating concepts from Abstract to Zestful that inform, underlie, and lend meaning to the exquisitely ruined images he creates by crinkling glossy images from fashion magazines until their sheen disappears and they become soft and elastic. Unmooring the magazine page from its familiar context, these beautiful rags are rendered poetic by Sparagana''s unique art of subtraction, which physically rubs away not only ink and material, but also transience and commercial usefulness. <br> Just as Sparagana''s work intervenes in existing images, so, too, do Bal''s explorations qualify existing concepts. But together, in this inaugural volume in the new series Project Tango: Artists and Writers Together, they have given rise to something wholly new: a prophetic one-artist dictionary that simultaneously reenvisions the untapped interactions of images with words and the potential forms of the bookitself.', 'Art'),

Critics called it "graffiti," but to the practitioners it was "writing." <p> "Taking the Train" traces the history of "writing" in New York City against the backdrop of the struggle that developed between the city and the writers. Austin tracks the ways in which "writing" -- a small, seemingly insignificant act of youthful rebellion -- assumed crisis-level importance inside the bureaucracy and the public relations of New York City mayoral administrations and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for almost two decades. "Taking the Train" reveals why a global city short on funds made "wiping out graffiti" an expensive priority while other needs went unfunded.

These words were spoken by Matisse just before the Armory Show in 1913--a pivotal moment, after which his work was seen in America as an example of what should be admired or deplored in modern art. <br>In this ambitious study, John O''Brian argues that Matisse''s sober presentations of himself were calculated to fit with the social constraints and ideological demands of the times. Matisse''s strategy included cooperating with museums, cultivating private collectors, playing off dealers one against another, and reassuring the media that, whatever his reputation as an avant-gardist, the conduct of his life was solidly bourgeois. <br>Moving from the late 1920s, when Matisse''s output was shedding its outlaw reputation, to the early 1950s, when his work was canonized, O''Brian shows how the way Matisse''s work was viewed changed as attention shifted away from the seductiveness of his subject matter to the seductiveness of his paint. The art''s resolute rejection of political concerns, its deployment of decorative design for visual satisfaction, and its representations of pleasure encouraged American audiences, who in the 1930s deemed the art disreputable, to celebrate its gratifications by the early years of the Cold War. <br>This intriguing, wide-ranging investigation of Matisse''s self-promotion, America''s uneasy embrace of modernism, and America''s consumer culture and politics provides a rich context to Clement Greenberg''s words published in the "Nation" in 1947: "Matisse''s cold hedonism and ruthless exclusion of everything but the concrete, immediate sensation will in the future, once we are away from the present "Zeitgeist," be better understood as the most profound mood of the first half of the twentieth century."<br>', 'Art'),

By contrast, the Indian way of doing businessas apparent in Indian mythology, but no longer seen in practice accommodates subjectivity and diversity, and offers an inclusive, more empathetic way of achieving success. Great value is placed on darshan, that is, on how we see the world and our relationship with Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. <br /><br /> Business Sutra uses stories, symbols and rituals drawn from Hindu, Jain and Buddhist mythology to understand a wide variety of business situations that range from running a successful tea stall to nurturing talent in a large multinational corporation. At the heart of the book is a compelling premise: if we believe that wealth needs to be chased, the workplace becomes a rana-bhoomia battleground of investors, regulators, employers, employees, vendors, competitors and customers; if we believe that wealth needs to be attracted, the workplace becomes a ranga-bhoomia playground where everyone is happy. <br /><br /> Brilliantly argued, original and thoroughly accessible, Business Sutra presents a radical and nuanced approach to management, business and leadership in a diverse, fast-changing, and increasingly polarized world. <br /><br /> <strong>About the Author :</strong></p>  <p><strong>Devdutt Pattanaik</strong> has written over twenty-five books and 400 articles on Indian mythology for everyone from adults to children. Since 2007, he has been explaining the relationship between mythology and management through his column in the Economic Times; the talk he gave at the TED India conference in 2009; and the show Business Sutra which ran successfully on CNBC-TV18 in 2010, besides numerous other lectures at Indian universities and management institutes. <br /><br /> Trained to be a doctor, he spent fifteen years in the healthcare (Apollo Health Street) and pharmaceutical (Sanofi Aventis) industries and worked briefly with Ernst &amp; Young as a business adviser before he turned his passion into a vocation and joined the think tank of the Future Group as its Chief Belief Officer.</p>  <div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>  <div class="description" style="float: right;">&nbsp;</div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Business and Economics'),

An essential for the meditation of Taoists for thousands of years, the "Tao Te Ching" is as beneficial and informative as it is enduring.

Svetlana Alpers''s study of 17th-century Dutch painting is a splendid example of this excitement and of the centrality of art history among current disciples. Professor Alpers puts forward a vividly argued thesis. There is, she says, a truly fundamental dichotomy between the art of the Italian Renaissance and that of the Dutch masters. . . . Italian art is the primary expression of a ''textual culture, '' this is to say of a culture which seeks emblematic, allegorical or philosophical meanings in a serious painting. Alberti, Vasari and the many other theoreticians of the Italian Renaissance teach us to ''read'' a painting, and to read it in depth so as to elicit and construe its several levels of signification. The world of Dutch art, by the contrast, arises from and enacts a truly ''visual culture.'' It serves and energises a system of values in which meaning is not ''read'' but ''seen, '' in which new knowledge is visually recorded."--George Steiner, "Sunday Times" <br>"There is no doubt that thanks to Alpers''s highly original book the study of the Dutch masters of the seventeenth century will be thoroughly reformed and rejuvenated. . . . She herself has the verve, the knowledge, and the sensitivity to make us see familiar sights in a new light."--E. H. Gombrich, "New York Review of Books"', 'Art'),

Had the aging artist turned reactionary, or is Picasso''s treatment of the theme more subversive than anyone has suspected? <br>In this innovative study, Karen L. Kleinfelder rejects the claim that Picasso''s later work was a failure. The failing, she claims, lies more in the way we typically have read the images, treating them merely as reflections of an "old-age" style or of the artist''s private life. <br>Focusing on graphics dating from 1954 to 1970, Kleinfelder shows how Picasso plays with the artist-model theme to extend, subvert, and parody both the possibilities and limits of representation. For Kleinfelder, Picasso''s graphic work both mystifies and demystifies the creative process, venerates and mocks the effects of aging and the artist''s self-image as a living "old master," and acknowledges and denies his own fear of death. <br>Using recent interpretive and literary theory, Kleinfelder probes the three-way relationship between artist, model, and canvas. The dynamics of this relationship provided Picasso with an open-ended textual framework for exploring the dichotomies of man/woman, self/other, and vitality/mortality. What unfolds is the artist''s struggle not only with the impossibility of representing the model on canvas, but also with the inevitability of his own death. <br>Kleinfelder explores how Picasso''s means of pursuing these issues allows him to defer closure on a long, productive career. By focusing on the graphics rather than the paintings, Kleinfelder contradicts the primacy of the painted "masterpiece"; shesteers the reader away from the assumption that the artist must work toward creating a final body of work that signifies the culmination of his search for a coherent identify. <br>Picasso''s search, she argues, realizes itself in the creative process. She interprets the late graphics not as a biographical statement but as a tool for investigating the possibilities of representation within the limits of Picasso''s medium and his lifetime. Richly illustrated, Kleinfelder''s book will open up new approaches to the late work of this complex artist. <br>', 'Art'),

Social conduct used to be easy. After all, there were rules, rules and more rules. But now, in the era of text messaging, metrosexuality, and internet dating, what''s a modern bloke to do? Thomas Blaikie has the answers. Part Ms. Manners, part Lynn truss, rip-roaringly funny, and oh-so-wonderfully British, Blaikie guides Americans through the labyrinth of twenty-first century etiquette. Who hasn''t wondered if they can disinivite a guest (You cannot, unless it is the culmination of a terrible argument) or if they can do drugs at the office Christmas party (No, unless actually provided by the boss). With grace, with and above all, good taste, Blaikie instructs readers when to "drop in" on a friend, how to send condolences, and ways to know if you are boring, and guides his readers through a myriad of modern social traumas. To The Manner Born is an essential for anyone with a blackberry, four e-mail accounts, and an eye toward pitch-perfect civlity.<br>Your friends neglect to RSVP to your party invitation . . . co-workers munch their pungent meals near your office . . . pedestrians shout into their cell phones and practically knock you to the pavement. <br>Wishing that friends, family, colleagues, and oblivious strangers would mind their manners is lovely, but what about your own? You don''t mean to be rude, but in today''s carefree, high-tech, fast-paced world, how are you supposed to know what to do? <br>Thankfully, Englishman Thomas Blaikie''s witty and insightful guide will help you steer through this minefield of uncertainty and back onto the path toward civility-without a lot of fuss and bother. No need to worry about the proper way to eat soup or which is the salad fork. What Blaikie teaches you is more important: how and when to drop in on a friend, how to turn down suitors graciously, how to "move on" at a party, how to end a text-message conversation that''s gone on just a bit too long, and how to cope with myriad other twenty-first-century social traumas.<br>Always positive and cheerful, "To the Manner Born" offers commonsense, practical solutions. And if you don''t like someone else''s manners, yes, you really should try to do something about it-in the nicest way possible, of course. <br>"Thomas Blaikie is the perfect guide through the treacherous minefield of contemporary social mores: witty, amusingly abstruse, stylish and most importantly knowledgeable." <br>-Will Self, author of "Cock and Bull <br>""If everyone followed the rules of this book, well, I would certainly go out more.

Shiller, a leading expert on market volatility, evokes Alan Greenspan''s infamous 1996 reference, "irrational exuberance," to explain the alternately soaring and declining stock market. Shiller''s unconventional yet persuasive argument credits an unprecedented confluence of events with driving stocks to uncharted heights, and he analyzes the structural, cultural, and psychological factors behind these levels of growth not reflected in any other sector of the economy. Now more relevant than ever, this analysis is both chilling and convincing--a must-read for the individual investor, the policy maker, and the investment professional.<br>In this timely and prescient update of his celebrated 2000 bestseller, Robert Shiller returns to the topic that gained him international fame: market volatility. Having predicted the stock market collapse that began just one month after the first edition was published, he now expands the book to cover other markets that have become volatile, particularly the recently red-hot housing market. He includes a full chapter on domestic and international housing prices in historical perspective. <br>Shiller amasses impressive evidence to support his argument that the recent housing market boom bears many similarities to the stock market bubble of the late 1990s, and may eventually be followed by declining home prices for years to come. After stocks plummeted when the bubble burst in 2000, investors moved their money into housing. This precipitated the inflated real estate prices not only in America but around the world, Shiller maintains. Hence, irrational exuberance did not disappear--it merely reappeared in other settings. <br>Building on the original edition, Shiller draws out the psychological origins of volatility in financial markets, this time folding real estate into his analysis. He broadens the evidence that investing in capital markets of all kinds in the modern free-market economy is inherently unstable--subject to the profoundly human influences captured in Alan Greenspan''s now-famous phrase, "irrational exuberance." As was true of its predecessor, the second edition of "Irrational Exuberance" is destined to be widely read, discussed, and debated.', 'Business and Economics'),

It is in perpetual motion (that''s why it has always fascinated artists: painters, photographers, filmmakers), animates all it touches, endlessly forges ahead, as though driven by the wind".<p>-- from The Devil''s Cloth<br>Michel Pastoureau''s lively study of stripes offers a unique and engaging perspective on the evolution of fashion, taste, and visual codes in Western culture. <p> "The Devil''s Cloth" begins with a medieval scandal. When the first Carmelites arrived in France from the Holy Land, the religious order required its members to wear striped habits, prompting turmoil and denunciations in the West that lasted fifty years until the order was forced to accept a quiet, solid color. The medieval eye found any surface in which a background could not be distinguished from a foreground disturbing. Thus, striped clothing was relegated to those on the margins or outside the social order -- jugglers and prostitutes, for example -- and in medieval paintings the devil himself is often depicted wearing stripes. The West has long continued to dress its slaves and servants, its crewmen and convicts in stripes.<p>But in the last two centuries, stripes have also taken on new, positive meanings, connoting freedom, youth, playfulness, and pleasure. Witness the revolutionary stripes on the French and United States flags. In a wide-ranging discussion that touches on zebras, awnings, and pajamas, augmented by illustrative plates, the author shows us how stripes have become chic, and even, in the case of bankers'' pin stripes, a symbol of taste and status. However, make the stripes too wide, and you have a gangster''s suit -- the devil''s cloth indeed', 'Art'),

Wu Hung answers this question through a comprehensive analysis of the screen, a major format and a popular pictorial motif in traditional China.<br>In the first exploration of Chinese paintings as both material products <br>and pictorial representations, "The Double Screen" shows how the <br>collaboration and tension between material form and image gives life to <br>a painting. A Chinese painting is often reduced to the image it bears; <br>its material form is dismissed; its intimate connection with social <br>activities and cultural conventions neglected. <br>A screen occupies a space and divides it, supplies an ideal surface for <br>painting, and has been a favorite pictorial image in Chinese art since <br>antiquity.

More manifesto than polite discussion, more call to action than criticism, "The Invisible Dragon" aims squarely at the hyper-institutionalism that, in Hickey''s view, denies the real pleasures that draw us to art in the first place. Deploying the artworks of Warhol, Raphael, Caravaggio, and Mapplethorpe and the writings of Ruskin, Shakespeare, Deleuze, and Foucault, Hickey takes on museum culture, arid academicism, sclerotic politics, and more--all in the service of making readers rethink the nature of art. A new introduction provides a context for earlier essays--what Hickey calls his "intellectual temper tantrums." A new essay, "American Beauty," concludes the volume with a historical argument that is a rousing paean to the inherently democratic nature of attention to beauty.<p>Written with a verve that is all too rare in serious criticism, this expanded and refurbished edition of "The Invisible Dragon" will be sure to captivate a new generation of readers, provoking the passionate reactions that are the hallmark of great criticism.', 'Art'),

Luxuriously illustrated with vintage photos.<br>"Dressing the Man" is the definitive guide to what men need to know in order to dress well and look stylish without becoming fashion victims. <p>Alan Flusser''s name is synonymous with taste and style. With his new book, he combines his encyclopedic knowledge of men''s clothes with his signature wit and elegance to address the fundamental paradox of modern men''s fashion: Why, after men today have spent more money on clothes than in any other period of history, are there fewer well-dressed men than at any time ever before? <p>According to Flusser, dressing well is not all that difficult, the real challenge lies in being able to acquire the right personalized instruction. Dressing well pivots on two pillars -- proportion and color. Flusser believes that "Permanent Fashionability," both his promise and goal for the reader, starts by being accountable to a personal set of physical trademarks and not to any kind of random, seasonally served-up collection of fashion flashes. <p>Unlike fashion, which is obliged to change each season, the face''s shape, the neck''s height, the shoulder''s width, the arm''s length, the torso''s structure, and the foot''s size remain fairly constant over time. Once a man learns how to adapt the fundamentals of permanent fashion to his physique and complexion, he''s halfway home. <p>Taking the reader through each major clothing classification step-by-step, this user-friendly guide helps you apply your own specifics to a series of dressing options, from business casual and formalwear to pattern-on-pattern coordination, or how to choose the most flattering clothing silhouette for your body type and shirt collar for your face. <p>A man''s physical traits represent hisindividual road map, and the quickest route toward forging an enduring style of dress is through exposure to the legendary practitioners of this rare masculine art. Flusser has assembled the largest andmost diverse collection of stylishly mantled men ever found in one book. Many never-before-seen vintage photographs from the era of Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire are employed to help illustrate the range and diversity of authentic men''s fashion. "Dressing the Man"''s sheer magnitude of options will enable the reader to expand both the grammar and verbiage of his permanent-fashion vocabulary. <p>For those men hoping to find sartorial fulfillment somewhere down the road, tethering their journey to the mind-set of permanent fashion will deliver them earlier rather than later in life.', 'Reference'),

The first comprehensive history of these world-famous monsters, "The Gargoyles of Notre-Dame" argues that they transformed the iconic thirteenth-century cathedral into a modern monument. <br>Michael Camille begins his long-awaited study by recounting architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc''s ambitious restoration of the structure from 1843 to 1864, when the gargoyles were designed, sculpted by the little-known Victor Pyanet, and installed. These gargoyles, Camille contends, were not mere avatars of the Middle Ages, but rather fresh creations--symbolizing an imagined past--whose modernity lay precisely in their nostalgia. He goes on to map the critical reception and many-layered afterlives of these chimeras, notably in the works of such artists and writers as Charles Meryon, Victor Hugo, and photographer Henri Le Secq. Tracing their eventual evolution into icons of high kitsch, Camille ultimately locates the gargoyles'' place in the twentieth-century imagination, exploring interpretations by everyone from Winslow Homer to the Walt Disney Company. <br>Lavishly illustrated with more than three hundred images of its monumental yet whimsical subjects, "The Gargoyles of Notre-Dame" is a must-read for historians of art and architecture and anyone whose imagination has been sparked by the lovable monsters gazing out over Paris from one of the world''s most renowned vantage points.', 'Art'),

Tracing those interconnections among art, science, and literature, Kemp leads us on a dazzling tour of Western thought, from Aristotelian physiognomy and its influence on phrenology to the Great Chain of Being and Darwinian evolution. We learn about the racist anthropology underlying a familiar Degas sculpture, see paintings of a remarkably simian Judas, and watch Mowgli, the man-child from Kipling''s "The Jungle Book," exhibit the behaviors of the beasts who raised him. Like a kaleidoscope, Kemp uses these stories to refract, reconfigure, and echo the essential truth that the way we think about animals inevitably inflects how we think about people, and vice versa. <br>Loaded with vivid illustrations and drawing on sources from Hesiod to La Fontaine, Leonardo to P.

Moving from pre-Columbian codices and sculpture through New World Baroque art and architecture to Neobaroque theory and contemporary Latin American fiction, Lois Parkinson Zamora argues for an integrated understanding of visual and verbal forms. <br>The New World Baroque combines indigenous, African, and European forms of expression, and, in the early decades of the twentieth century, Latin American writers began to recuperate its visual structures to construct an alternative account of modernity, using its hybrid forms for the purpose of creating a discourse of "counterconquest"--a postcolonial self-definition aimed at disrupting entrenched power structures, perceptual categories, and literary forms." <br>Z"amora engages this process, discussing a wide range of visual forms--Baroque facades and altarpieces, portraits of saints and martyrs (including the self-portraits of Frida Kahlo), murals from indigenous artisans to Diego Rivera--to elucidate works of fiction by Borges, Carpentier, Lezama Lima, Sarduy, Garro, Garcia Marquez, and Galeano, and also to establish a critical perspective external to their work. Because visual media are "other" to the verbal economy of modern fiction, they serve these writers (and their readers) as oblique means by which to position their fiction culturally, politically, and aesthetically. <br>The first study of its kind in scope and ambition, "The Inordinate Eye" departs radically from most studies of literature by demonstrating howtranscultural conceptions of the visual image have conditioned present ways of seeing and reading in Latin America.', 'Art'),

Yet despite the initial indifference with which it was first met, American art flourished against the odds and founded the aesthetic consciousness that we equate with American art today. <p>In this exhilarating study David Rosand shows how early American painters transformed themselves from provincial followers of the established traditions of Europe into some of the most innovative and influential artists in the world. Moving beyond simple descriptions of what distinguishes American art from other movements and forms, "The Invention of Painting in America" explores not only the status of artists and their personal relationship to their work but also the larger dialogue between the artist and society. Rosand looks to the intensely studied portraits of America''s early painters -- especially Copley and Eakins and the landscapes of Homer and Inness, among others -- each of whom grappled with conflicting cultural attitudes and different expressive styles in order to reinvent the art of painting. He discusses the work of Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, Pollock, Rothko, and Motherwell and the subjects and themes that engaged them. While our current understanding of America''s place in art is largely based on the astonishing success of a handful of mid-twentieth-century painters, Rosand unearths the historical and artistic conditions that both shaped and inspired the phenomenon of Abstract Expressionism.', 'Art'),

While art historians have wrestled with these images and objects, very few scientists have weighed in on Paleolithic art as artifacts of a complex, living society. R. Dale Guthrie is one of the first to do so, and his monumental volume "The Nature of Paleolithic Art" is a landmark study that will change the shape of our understanding of these marvelous images. <br>With a natural historian''s keen eye for observation, and as one who has spent a lifetime using bones and other excavated materials to piece together past human behavior and environments, Guthrie demonstrates that Paleolithic art is a mode of expression we can comprehend to a remarkable degree and that the perspective of natural history is integral to that comprehension. He employs a mix of ethology, evolutionary biology, and human universals to access these distant cultures and their art and artifacts. Guthrie uses innovative forensic techniques to reveal new information; estimating, for example, the ages and sexes of some of the artists, he establishes that Paleolithic art was not just the creation of male shamans. <br>With more than 3,000 images, "The Nature of Paleolithic Art" offers the most comprehensive representation of Paleolithic art ever published and a radical (and controversial) new way of interpreting it. The variety and content of these images--most of which have never been available or easily accessible to nonspecialists or even researchers--will astonish you. This wonderfully written work of natural history, of observationand evidence, tells the great story of our deepest past.', 'Art'),

Together with Bill Gates, Ballmer leads the company he and Gates took from less than 30 employees to some 50,000, and annual revenues from $12 million to more than $20 billion and rising. A balanced portrait, this book reveals the good boy Ballmer -- the dedicated son who once took three months off to care for his ailing parents, and the bad boy Ballmer -- the ruthless businessman who at the same time devised and led a scorched earth policy against other software developers, a policy that earned him the nickname "The Em-balmer." &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Bad Boy Ballmer&lt;/I&gt; is also the definitive story of the Bill Gates/Steve Ballmer relationship, from their 1974 meeting at a Harvard dorm to the present.

Fascinated with the potential of glass architecture, Scheerbart''s satirical fantasies envisioned an electrified future, a world composed entirely of crystalline, colored glass. In 1912, Scheerbart published "The Light Club of Batavia," a "Novelle "about the formation of a club dedicated to building a spa for bathing--not in water, but in light--at the bottom of an abandoned mineshaft. Translated here into English for the first time, this rare story serves as a point of departure for Josiah McElheny, who, with an esteemed group of collaborators, offers a fascinating array of responses to this enigmatic work. "The Light Club" makes clear that the themes of utopian hope, desire, and madness in Scheerbart''s tale represent a part of modernism''s lost project: a world based on political and spiritual ideals rather than efficiency and logic. In his compelling introduction, McElheny describes Scheerbart''s life as well as his own enchantment with the writer, and he explains the ways in which "The Light Club of Batavia "inspired him to produce art of uncommon breadth. "The Light Club "also features inspired writings from Gregg Bordowitz and Ulrike Muller, Andrea Geyer, and Branden W. Joseph, as well as translations of original texts by and about Scheerbart.

In this ground-breaking work, Joseph Leo Koerner analyzes the historical origin of this model in the art of Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien, the first modern self-portraitist and his principal disciple. By doing so, he develops new approaches to the visual image and to its history in early modern European culture. Koerner establishes the character of German Renaissance art by considering how Durer''s and Baldung''s pictures register changes in the status of the self during the sixteenth century. He contends that Durer''s self-portrait of 1500, modeled after icons of Christ, reinvented art for new conditions of piety, labor, patronage, and self-understanding at the eve of the Reformation. So foundational is this invention to modern aesthetics, Koerner argues, that interpreting it takes us to the limits of traditional art-historical method. Self-portraiture becomes legible less through a history leading up to it, or through a sum of contexts that occasion it, than through its historical sight-line to the present. After a thorough examination of Durer''s startlingly new self-portraits, the author turns to the work of Baldung, Durer''s most gifted pupil, and demonstrates how the apprentice willfully disfigured Durer''s vision. Baldung replaced the master''s self-portraits with some of the most obscene and bizarre pictures in the history of art. In images of nude witches, animated cadavers, and copulating horses, Baldung portrays the debased self of the viewer as the true subject of art. The Moment of Self-Portraiturethus unfolds as passages from teacher to student, artist to viewer, reception, all within a culture that at once deified and abhorred originality. Koerner writes a new, philosophical art history in which the visual image is both document of history and living vehicle of thought. He demonstrates the extent to which novel ideas about self and interpretation invented by Renaissance artists and Reformation thinkers informed modern hermeneutics and helped to found our deepest assumptions about art and its messages.<br>In this groundbreaking and elegantly written study, Joseph Koerner <br>establishes the character of Renaissance art in Germany. Opening up new <br>modes of inquiry for historians of art and early modern Europe, Koerner <br>examines how artists such as Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien <br>reflected in their masterworks the changing status of the self in <br>sixteenth-century Germany. <br>" A] dazzling book. . . .

The questions tackled here are fundamental ones: Is our experience of color an illusion? How does the metaphysical status of colors differ from that of shapes? What is the difference between a picture and a written text? Why are some pictures said to be more realistic than others? Is it because they are especially truthful or, on the contrary, because they deceive the eye? <br>"The Objective Eye" explores the fundamental concepts we use constantly in our most innocent thoughts and conversations about art, as well as in the most sophisticated art theory.

In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home-is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. <br />Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does-and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation- autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.</p>', 'Business and Economics'),

Gathering the expertise of more than 50 leaders of multinational corporations and backed by an array of case studies showing existing best practices, "Changing Course "provides an extensive analysis of how the business community can adapt and contribute to the crucial goal of sustainable development - which combines the objectives of environmental protection and economic growth. All of its recommendations are linked by the belief that only by allowing market forces to operate freely and integrating the "polluter pays" principle into environmental and economic policy can sustainable development be achieved. "Changing Course "focuses first on the often adversarial relationship between business and government in chapters that discuss full-cost pricing and market signals, energy, capital markets, trade, and managing change. It shows how environmental costs, which are often invisible, can best be factored into production, investment, and trade. And it calls for a rational long-term energy strategy that balances the energy needs for economic development with a policy shift toward the payment of pollution costs and energy efficiency - changes that demand new thinking and increased flexibility by policy makers in both the public and the private sectors. "Changing Course "then explores business to business relationships, beginning with the sensitive topic of corporate reporting in environmental areas and discussion of how an environmentally conscious firm is managed.Chapters look at optimal products and processes, product stewardship in retail and trading companies, at new practices for such renewable resource industries as forestry and agriculture, and at the need for new long-term partnerships to boost economic development and environmental standards in the developing world. "Changing Course "concludes with a detailed look at the implications of sustainable development for business in the developing world, where, as former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi pointed out, poverty itself is a great polluter.

Pygmalion''s mythical sculpture, which magnanimous gods endowed with life after he fell in love with it, marks perhaps the first such instance in Western art history of an image that exists on its own terms, rather than simply imitating something (or someone) else. In "The Pygmalion Effect," Victor I. Stoichita delivers this living image--as well as its many avatars over the centuries--from the long shadow cast by art that merely replicates reality. <br>Stoichita traces the reverberations of Ovid''s founding myth from ancient times through the advent of cinema. Emphasizing its erotic origins, he locates echoes of this famous fable in everything from legendary incarnations of Helen of Troy to surrealist painting to photographs of both sculpture and people artfully posed to simulate statues. But it was only with the invention of moving pictures, Stoichita argues, that the modern age found a fitting embodiment of the Pygmalion story''s influence. Concluding with an analysis of Alfred Hitchcock films that focuses on Kim Novak''s double persona in "Vertigo," "The Pygmalion Effect" illuminates the fluctuating connections that link aesthetics, magic, and technical skill. In the process, it sheds new light on a mysterious world of living artifacts that, until now, has occupied a dark and little-understood realm in the history of Western image making.', 'Art'),

We can convince ourselves that a painting of a bowl of fruit or a man in a room appears to be real by the ways these objects are rendered. Likewise, the trick of perspective can prevent us from being absorbed in a scene. Connecting contemporary critical theory with close readings of seventeenth-century Dutch visual culture, "The Rhetoric of Perspective" puts forth the claim that painting is a form of thinking and that perspective functions as the language of the image. <br>Aided by a stunning full-color gallery, Hanneke Grootenboer proposes a new theory of perspective based on the phenomenological aspects of non-narrative still-life, trompe l''oeil, and anamorphic imagery. Drawing on playful and mesmerizing baroque images, Grootenboer characterizes what she calls their "sophisticated deceit," asserting that painting is more about visual representation than about its supposed objects. Grootenboer demonstrates how these paintings--ones that are often marginalized by art historical discourse--skillfully articulate the complexities of the visual and, consequently, gain new relevance in the context of recent interest in visual theory. <br>Offering an original theory of perspective''s impact on pictorial representation, the act of looking, and the understanding of truth in painting, Grootenboer shows how these paintings both question the status of representation and explore the limits and credibility of perception.', 'Art'),

One of the four great painters of the middle Ming period, the ambitious T''ang Yin rose above the merchant class into which he was born to become a member of the elite scholarly circle in the city of Suchou. Deprived by accident of his academic degrees and so forced to paint for a living, T''ang Yin became a social anomaly whose style of life cut across the conventions of his time. His experiences throw into sharp relief the realities faced by a Chinese painter who was both elite Confucian scholar and professional painter. <br>Anne De Coursey Clapp''s work also explores larger issues of Ming painting raised by the artist''s turbulent career. She describes the social and intellectual values exalted in Ming Suchou, its system of patronage, the contrast between the professional and amateur artist, and the formative influence of twelfth-century Sung dynasty styles on Suchou painters. Clapp shows how T''ang Yin''s artistic inventions were made in the course of leading the revival of Sung dynasty styles in Suchou: tracing T''ang Yin''s early studies of ancient and contemporary masters, she describes how he reworked an antique style, converting it into a vehicle of expression that reached fruition in a long series of fresh and powerful paintings of landscapes and birds-and-flowers. In the process, she revises the distorted version of middle Ming painting written by later Chinese art theorists to justify their own social and artistic values, noting especially the role of art patrons and their effect on artistic production. <br>Clapp analyzes the increasing currency ofpainting as a means of social exchange in ancient China. In particular, she identifies commemorative painting as a major genre of the later dynasties and explores the role it played in the "oeuvres" of professional masters with its humanistic implications for the Chinese view of the ideal scholarly man. Her broad view of T''ang Yin''s career shows him divided between the professional and amateur camps of his time: in landscape and figural subjects he was aligned with the professionals; in flower subjects with the amateurs. Clap argues that the uneven distribution of styles and genres between this master who was subject to the market, and those who were independent of it, suggests that T''ang deliberately tried to expand the range of his paintings in order to appeal to buyers in the lower educational and social strata. Illustrated by some of T''ang Yin''s most celebrated paintings and by some which are published for the first time, her work is of tremendous importance to art, literary, and cultural historians of Ming China. <br>"In this important work, Anne de Coursey Clapp has drawn a clear picture of T''ang Yin''s life, patronage relationships, and contribution to the history of Chinese painting. In the person of T''ang Yin, she has chosen an ideal focus around which to examine some of the misleading stereotypes <br>which have distorted our understanding of Chinese painting since the seventeenth century. Marked by analytical clarity and scrupulous scholarship, her work is a welcome addition to the few works in English on individual Chinese artists."--Louise Yuhas, Occidental College', 'Art'),

He also discusses the decline of manuscript illumination, the rise of modern coinage, the production of new-style flags and altar cloths, and the arrival in Russia of the new cartography and the new heraldry. Cracraft draws special attention to the early history of the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts, and to the impact of Peter''s program on popular imagery and on the cult art of the Russian Orthodox Church.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world''s number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world''s fourth-highest per capita real income?<p> The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore''s charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.<p> Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city-state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.<p> Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state''s security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial-era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.<p> In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always "to be correct, not politically correct." Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today''s safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee''s unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: "If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one."<p> Though Lee''s domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry-spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.<p> Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children -- particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore''s deputy prime minister.<p> For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. "From Third World to First" offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary''s heart, soul, and mind.', 'Business and Economics'),

For a basic understanding of the financial crisis, a primer on the global financial crisis is offered and some proposals for reforms are also offered. One of the consequences of the crisis is the shift in the balance of economic power in favour of Asia. Yet another focus of the book is the role of central banks in the evolution of the global financial crisis, in particular the role played by central banks in developing countries. Explanations with regard to the causes of the global financial crisis and an overview of the prolonged extensive excesses that acted synchronically to cause the global crisis are discussed in detail.</p>  <p>The second section of the book focuses on the future of the financial sector with some cautious remarks about uncertain recovery and prospects for the futures. The financial regulation in developing countries is highlighted. The emerging issues in the financial section are discussed in detail. The future of globalisation of finance and the global regulation of the financial sector is discussed as well.

Divided into sections on the practice and study of design, the essays in "The Politics of the Artificial" cover such topics as design history, design research, design as a political tool, sustainable design, and the problems of design''s relation to advanced technologies. Margolin also examines the work of key practitioners such as the matrix designer Ken Isaacs. Throughout the book Margolin demonstrates the underlying connections between the many ways of reflecting on and practicing design. He argues for the creation of an international, interdisciplinary field of design research and proposes a new ethical agenda for designers and researchers that encompasses the responsibility to users, the problems of sustainability, and the complicated questions of how to set boundaries for applying advanced technology to solve the problems of human life. <br>Opinionated and erudite, Victor Margolin''s "The Politics of the Artificial" breaks fresh ground in its call for a new approach to design research and practice.

And over the years, the commission''s domain has expanded dramatically to include everything from parks and courthouses to trash cans and sidewalks. In "The" "Politics of Urban Beauty," Michele H. Bogart argues that this unprecedented authority has made the commission host to some complex negotiations--involving artists, architects, business leaders, activists, and politicians--about not only the role of art in urban design, but also the shape and meaning of the city and its public spaces. <br>A former vice president of the ACNY, Bogart tells its story here from an insider''s perspective, tracing the commission''s history from its origins as an outgrowth of progressive reform to its role in New York''s reconstruction after 9/11. Drawing on archival correspondence, drawings, and photographs from commission collections, Bogart presents bracing examples of works--ranging from New Deal murals to Louis Kahn''s unbuilt Memorial to Six Million Jewish Martyrs--that illuminate the ACNY''s subtle yet powerful role in shaping New York''s identity. <br>"The Politics of Urban Beauty" is thus a fascinating history of a New York art world that paralleled--and sometimes unpredictably intersected with--the more familiar realm of prominent architects, painters, galleries, and museums. Bogart''s fresh view adds a critical dimension to our understanding of "the city beautiful" and makes an important and lively contribution to the study of art history, urban design, and New York City itself. <p>', 'Art'),

Proposing an archeology of artistic knowledge, Hulse examines the theoretical language through which the poets, painters, and patrons of the Renaissance conceived of the relationship between the arts. That language is embedded in what he calls a "rule of art," a specific set of categories, assumptions, and practices that defined the two art forms and the relationship between them. Hulse charts the rise of both forms to the status of liberal arts requiring special intellectual training for artist and patron alike. In the process, he uncovers the history of the practice of theory in the Renaissance, revealing how artistic discourse lived in the world. <br>', 'Art'),

He pinpoints the winners and the losers in the Free universe.

Here Anthony Julius traces the history of subversion in art from the outraged response to Manet''s "Le Dejeuner sur l''Herbe" to the scandal caused by the grant programs of the National Endowment for the Arts a century and a half later. Throughout the book, and supported by the work of such artists as Marcel Duchamp, the Chapman brothers, Andres Serrano, Damien Hirst, Gilbert & George, Paul McCarthy, Jeff Koons, Hans Haacke, and Anselm Kiefer, Julius shows how the modern period has been characterized by three kinds of transgressive art: an art that perverts established art rules; an art that defiles the beliefs and sentiments of its audience; and an art that challenges and disobeys the rules of the state. <br>The evidence assembled, Julius concludes his hard-hitting dissection of the landscapes of contemporary art by posing some important questions: what is art''s future when its boundary-exceeding, taboo-breaking endeavors become the norm? And is anything of value lost when we submit to art''s violation? <br>"Transgressions" is not a comfortable--still less a comforting--read, but it has a powerful urgency that makes it an essential document for anyone involved in our cultural life at the beginning of the twenty-first century.', 'Art'),

Through trenchant analysis, Nicole R. Fleetwood reorients the problem of black visibility by turning attention to what it means to see blackness and to the performative codes that reinforce, resignify, and disrupt its meaning. Working across visual theory and performance studies, Fleetwood asks, How is the black body visualized as both familiar and disruptive? How might we investigate the black body as a troubling presence to the scopic regimes that define it as such? How is value assessed based on visible blackness? <br>Fleetwood documents multiple forms of engagement with the visual, even as she meticulously underscores how the terms of engagement change in various performative contexts. Examining a range of practices from the documentary photography of Charles "Teenie" Harris to the "excess flesh" performances of black female artists and pop stars to the media art of Fatimah Tuggar to the iconicity of Michael Jackson, Fleetwood reveals and reconfigures the mechanics, codes, and metaphors of blackness in visual culture.', 'Art'),

TV by Design" uncovers this captivating story of how modernism and network television converged and intertwined in their mutual ascent during the decades of the cold war.<br>Whereas most histories of television focus on the way older forms of entertainment were recycled for the new medium, Lynn Spigel shows how TV was instrumental in introducing the public to the latest trends in art and design. Abstract expressionism, pop art, art cinema, modern architecture, and cutting-edge graphic design were all mined for staging techniques, scenic designs, and an ever-growing number of commercials. As a result, TV helped fuel the public craze for trendy modern products, such as tailfin cars and boomerang coffee tables, that was vital to the burgeoning postwar economy. And along with influencing the look of television, many artists--including Eero Saarinen, Ben Shahn, Saul Bass, William Golden, and Richard Avedon--also participated in its creation as the networks put them to work designing everything from their corporate headquarters to their company cufflinks.

Danto''s essays not only critique bodies of work but reflect upon art''s conceptual evolution as well, drawing for the reader a kind of "philosophical map" indicating how art and the criteria for judging it has changed over the twentieth century. In "Unnatural Wonders" the renowned critic finds himself at a point when contemporary art has become wholly pluralistic, even chaotic-with one medium as good as another-and when the moment for the "next thing" has already passed. So the theorist goes in search of contemporary art''s most exhilarating achievements, work that bridges the gap between art and life, which, he argues, is now the definitive art of our time. <p>Danto considers the work of such young artists as John Currin and Renee Cox and older living masters including Gerhard Richter and Sol LeWitt. He discusses artists of the New York School, like Philip Guston and Joan Mitchell, and international talents, such as the South African William Kentridge. Danto conducts a frank analysis of Matthew Barney''s "The Cremaster Cycle," Damien Hirst''s skeletons and anatomical models, and Barbara Kruger''s tchotchke-ready slogans; finds the ghost of Henry James in the work of Barnett Newman; and muses on recent Whitney Biennials and art influenced by 9/11.

In "Untwisting the Serpent," Daniel Albright shows that this perception arises partly because we usually consider each art form in isolation, even though many of the most important artistic experiments of the Modernists were collaborations involving several media--Igor Stravinsky''s "The Rite of Spring" is a ballet, Gertrude Stein''s "Four Saints in Three Acts" is an opera, and Pablo Picasso turned his cubist paintings into costumes for "Parade." <br>Focusing on collaborations with a musical component, Albright views these works as either figures of dissonance that try to retain the distinctness of their various media (e.g. Guillaume Apollinaire''s "Les Mamelles de Tiresias") or figures of consonance that try to lose themselves in some total effect (e.g. Arnold Schoenberg''s "Erwartung"). In so doing he offers a fresh picture of Modernism, and provides a compelling model for the analysis of all artistic collaborations. <br>"Untwisting the Serpent" is the recipient of the 2001 Susanne M.

In this book marketing guru Jack Trout clears up the confusion that surrounds the marketing profession. Instead of focusing on segmentation or customer retention or search engine optimzation or data mining, marketers should be searching for that simple, obvious differentiation idea. Merketers not looking for the obvious had better have a very low price.<br/><br/>This search should begin with what Trout considers the best book ever written on marketing - even though it was published in 1916 and isn''t about marketing. Entitled Obvious Adams: The Story of a Successful Business Man, it lays out the five tests of an obvious idea that will lead you to the right marketing strategy for any product. To find these principles for finding the obvious to life, Trout finds obvious solutions to today''s troubles for the likes of GM, Coke, Wal-Mart, newspapers, and the bewildering beer business. The fundamental problem is that effective marketing is both complicated and extremely simple - so simple that professional marketers overlook the most obvious and effective ideas entirely, in an attempt to be clever or creative.

The city came to prominence under Duke Federico da Montefeltro, a man who embodied the virtues of the active and contemplative life that were characteristic of the Renaissance. His city, however, guards its secrets well. A superficial visit may disclose some of its beauty and antiquity, but not its significance. It is the purpose of this book to showcase Urbino''s beauty and to explain its historical and cultural importance. <br>June Osborne traces the history of the city back to its Roman origins and goes on to paint a colorful panorama of Renaissance Italy, detailing the rivalries, alliances, and treacheries between dukes, princes, emperors, and popes that were fought out during this most fruitful period of scholarship and creative output. She explains how Urbino emerged from political turmoil to become the wealthiest and most illustrious court in Europe, a magnet for artists and writers such as Piero della Francesca, Paolo Uccello, and Torquato Tasso, and the acknowledged centre of Renaissance ideals as expounded in Baldassare Castiglione''s "The Book of the Courier," <br>With Newly commissioned photographs by Joe Cornish and a Foreword by Sir John Mortimer, this is the first book solely on Urbino to be published in English, making it essential reading for anyone with an interest in Italian history or art.<br>During the Renaissance, the Italian city of Urbino rivaled Florence and Siena as a center of art, culture, and commerce. Chances are you''ve never heard of it--but you should have. Raphael was born there. Piero della Francesca painted his famous "The Flagellation" there. And the city''s exquisite Ducal Palace, its twin towers piercing the sky, remains a striking monument to grace and power. Yet despite all its past glory and present charm, Urbino is practically unknown to tourists today. <br>With "Urbino: The Story of a Renaissance City," art historian June Osborne brings to life not only the great city and its art but also its turbulent history and the intrigue surrounding its ruling family. First settled by the ancient Umbrians, Urbino reached its zenith during the fifteenth century under the rule of Duke Federico da Montefeltro and his son Guidobaldo. Federico may have been a usurper and a fierce, opportunistic warlord, but his lust for power was more than matched by his passion for great art. Indeed it was under his direct guidance that the magnificent Ducal Palace was built--its perfectly proportioned courtyard a wonder of early Renaissance architecture. <br>Today the Ducal Palace hosts the National Gallery of the Marches, one of the most important art galleries in Italy, featuring works by no lesser lights than Raphael, Uccello, Piero della Francesca, and Titian. Exploring such sites as the fourteenth-century Oratorio di San Giovanni Battista and the Gothic Church of San Domenico, Osborne captures not only the startling beauty of Urbino and the Apennine foothills but also the tumultuous legacy of Frederico and his son (and their many wives and courtiers). <br>With over a hundredlavish color photographs, many by renowned landscape photographer Joe Cornish, "Urbino" is the best--and the only--guide to this gem of the Italian Marches. <br>', 'Art'),

Disdained by avant-garde artists, feminists, and activists, beauty and its major symbols of art--the female subject and ornament--became modernist taboos. To this day it is hard to champion beauty in art without sounding aesthetically or politically retrograde. Steiner argues instead that the experience of beauty is a form of communication, a subject-object interchange in which finding someone or something beautiful is at the same time recognizing beauty in oneself. This idea has led artists and writers such as Marlene Dumas, Christopher Bram, and Cindy Sherman to focus on the long-ignored figure of the model, who function in art as both a subject and an object. Steiner concludes "Venus in Exile" on a decidedly optimistic note, demonstrating that beauty has created a new and intensely pleasurable direction for contemporary artistic practice. <br>', 'Art');

When the Marines he accompanied reached the village, they ordered the civilians there to evacuate their homes--grass huts whose thatched roofs they set ablaze with Zippo lighters. Safer''s report on the event soon aired on CBS and was among the first to paint a harrowing portrait of the War in Vietnam. LBJ responded to the segment furiously, accusing Safer of having "shat on the American flag." For the first time since World War II, American boys in uniform had been portrayed as murderers instead of liberators. Our perception of the war--and the Zippo lighter--would never be the same. <br>But as this stunning book attests, the Zippo was far more than an instrument of death and destruction. For the American soldiers who wielded them, they were a vital form of social protest as well. "Vietnam Zippos" showcases the engravings made by U.S. soldiers on their lighters during the height of the conflict, from 1965 to 1973. In a real-life version of the psychedelic war portrayed in Francis Ford Coppola''s "Apocalypse Now," Sherry Buchanan tells the fascinating story of how the humble Zippo became a talisman and companion for American GIs during their tours of duty. Through a dazzling array of images, we see how Zippo lighters were used during the war, and we discover how they served as a canvas for both personal and political expression during the Age of Aquarius, engraved with etchings of peace signs and marijuana leaves and slogans steepedin all the rock lyrics, sound bites, combat slang, and antiwar mottos of the time. <br>Death from Above.

The most public medium in the country today, graffiti can signal territory, love, or liberation. Ironically, graffiti is understood by only a fraction of those who encounter it. Usually read as a sign of urban decay and as a loss of control over the physical environment, graffiti has become one of the most potent cultural languages of our age. "Wallbangin''" is an unprecedented, in-depth look at this phenomenon as it is embodied in the neighborhoods of one of its epicenters, Los Angeles. <br>Anthropologist Susan Phillips enters the lives of the African-American and Chicano gang members to write a comprehensive guide to their symbolic and visual expression. She not only decodes the graffiti--explaining how, for instance, gang boundaries are visually delimited and how "memorial" graffiti functions--but she also places it in the context of the changing urban landscapes within the city. Graffiti, she argues, is inextricably linked to political change, to race, and to art, and she demonstrates how those connections are played out in contemporary L.A. "Wallbangin''" is, on this level, an iconography of street imagery. But it is also a very personal narrative about entering the world of L.A. street gangs--a world of pride, enemies, affirmation, and humanity where gang members use graffiti to redefine their social and political position in society. <br>To many outsiders, graffiti is cryptic, senseless scribbling. But Phillips explains it as an ingenious and creative solution to the disenfranchisement felt by those who produce it. With personal narratives, provocative photography, andcontemporary voices, "Wallbangin''" unlocks the mysteries behind street-level ideologies and their visual manifestations. <br>', 'Art'),

Why do we behave as if pictures were alive, possessing the power to influence us, to demand things from us, to persuade us, seduce us, or even lead us astray? <br>According to W. J. T. Mitchell, we need to reckon with images not just as inert objects that convey meaning but as animated beings with desires, needs, appetites, demands, and drives of their own. "What Do Pictures Want?" explores this idea and highlights Mitchell''s innovative and profoundly influential thinking on picture theory and the lives and loves of images. Ranging across the visual arts, literature, and mass media, Mitchell applies characteristically brilliant and wry analyses to Byzantine icons and cyberpunk films, racial stereotypes and public monuments, ancient idols and modern clones, offensive images and found objects, American photography and aboriginal painting. Opening new vistas in iconology and the emergent field of visual culture, he also considers the importance of Dolly the Sheep--who, as a clone, fulfills the ancient dream of creating a living image--and the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, which, among other things, signifies a new and virulent form of iconoclasm.<br>"What Do Pictures Want?" offers an immensely rich and suggestive account of the interplay between the visible and the readable. A work by one of our leading theorists of visual representation, it will be a touchstone for art historians, literary critics, anthropologists, and philosophers alike.', 'Art'),

It bids them, instead, to become citizens who take a leading role in shaping their surroundings." The Pulitzer Prize-winning "Chicago Tribune" critic has taught millions of readers exactly what this approach can do in the decade he has been writing his fiery, intelligent essays on the state of contemporary architecture. Working from the palette of Chicago, America''s foremost architectural city, Kamin also paints on a broad canvas, and in his work he has assessed everything from Frank Gehry''s Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain to the "green skyscraper" as it is developing in Germany to the haunting U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. <br>"Why Architecture Matters" collects the best of Kamin''s columns, including his acclaimed series advocating the intelligent development of Chicago''s lakefront. The columns are organized thematically, providing an accessible and provocative view of architecture in the 1990s, from soaring skyscrapers to vibrant immigrant neighborhoods, troubled public housing projects and sprawling suburbs. Because Chicago serves as a barometer of national design trends, these writings shed new light on American architecture and urbanism during a decade that Kamin labels "The Nervous Nineties"--a period of unparalleled affluence and underlying anxiety, of soothing retro buildings and provocative new ones that express the frenzied state of modern life. As Kamindemonstrates in his piercing, often witty, critiques, Chicago perfectly represents the era''s contradictions, rediscovering itself as a city but losing its architectural nerve. <br>An architecture critic''s most important role, Kamin believes, is to articulate standards that help people judge the quality of their surroundings, contrasting the esoteric theory of how buildings and public places are supposed to work with the unpredictable reality of everyday life. Throughout "Why Architecture Matters," he pursues the question of how people actually use space, and how architects and planners might better design it to enrich human experience. Architecture matters, Kamin argues, because it simultaneously reflects and affects how we live. "Every building," he writes, "is a new piece of the evolving metropolis, a new layer of the ever-changing urban collage. This collective work of art forms an unflinching record of who we are and what we do."<br>For more than a decade, Pulitzer Prize-winning "Chicago Tribune" architecture critic Blair Kamin has been writing fiery, intelligent essays on the state of contemporary architecture. His subjects range from high-rises to highways, parks to public housing, Frank Lloyd Wright to Frank Gehry. "Why Architecture Matters" collects the best of Kamin''s acclaimed columns, offering both a look at America''s foremost architectural city and a taste of Kamin''s penetrating, witty style of critique.', 'Art'),

September, 11, 2001, defined tragedy for a generation. On that day Deepak Chopra found himself driving from city to city, meeting thousands of people who begged for meaning and solace in the face of suffering. In response he has written The Deeper Wound, offering a way of healing as a memorial to the thousands of victims who perished. <br>The opening section, "In the Face of Tragedy," defines suffering as the pain that threatens to make life meaningless. When our deepest needs go unfulfilled, suffering begins. We begin to heal when we go beyond personal anger and fear to a realization of our true self, the self that was never afraid and can never be wounded. <br>The true self contains the light that no darkness can attack. Having described a path of awareness and compassion that leads to the light, the second half of The Deeper Wound takes us there through "A Hundred Days of Healing," daily affirmations, exercises, insights, lessons, and questions--each a step out of pain toward a higher reality. "We can become living memorials to tragedy by restoring the power of life," writes Deepak Chopra. "You are that life, you are that power. Let us see if we can find the spark that will make the spiritual flame spring up." <p>"Healing yourself comes in two stages--first releasing the energy of suffering, then replacing it with the soul''s energy. It is a gentle and fragile path, very much like holding on to a thread as it leads you from step to step. <br>If you take the time tolisten to the voice of silence, you will be astonished at the power you have at your command, however long that power has been overlooked. <br>A portion of the proceeds earned by the author and publisher from the sale of this book will be donated to the Red Cross to aid in humanitarian relief efforts around the world.', 'Body, Mind and Spirit'),

His significance lies in his fostering of modern Pan-Arab thought, institutions, and policies, his transformation of Egypt from a feudal state under British protection to a developing industrial nation, and his contributions to third world politics. Despite his importance, however, the last thorough examination of Nasser''s life and impact was published more than twenty years ago. Faysal Mikdadi''s volume helps to draw together the writing on Nasser and to re-examine the origins of his thinking and the impact of his writings and policies. After a capsule biography of Nasser and a detailed chronology, the volume is divided into chapters covering specific aspects of Nasser''s life. Each chapter contains explanatory notes and a full bibliography. In addition to citing works in English, Arabic, and French, Mikdadi has included works from other major languages as well. Each bibliographical citation is accompanied by a brief summary note. The volume concludes with comprehensive author, periodical, and subject indexes.

Critics of the time feared that market hype and self-promotion threatened the integrity of art. They lashed out at contemporary art, questioning the validity of particular media and methods and dividing the art into opposing camps. While controversies have since subsided, critics still view art of the 1980s as a stylistic battlefield. Alison Pearlman rejects this picture, which is truer of the period''s criticism than of its art. <br>Pearlman reassesses the works and careers of six artists who became critics'' biggest targets. In each of three chapters, she pairs two artists the critics viewed as emblematic of a given trend: Julian Schnabel and David Salle in association with Neo-Expressionism; Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring vis-a-vis Graffiti Art; and Peter Halley and Jeff Koons in relation to Simulationism. Pearlman shows how all these artists shared important but unrecognized influences and approaches: a crucial and overwhelming inheritance of 1960s and 1970s Conceptualism, a Warholian understanding of public identity, and a deliberate and nuanced use of past styles and media. Through in-depth discussions of works, from Haring''s body-paintings of Grace Jones to Schnabel''s movie "Basquiat," Pearlman demonstrates how these artists'' interests exemplified a broader, generational shift unrecognized by critics. She sees this shift as starting not in the 1980s but in the mid-1970s, when key developments in artistic style, art-world structures, and consumer culture converged to radically alter the course of American art. <br>"Unpackaging Art of the 1980s" offers an innovative approach to one of the most significant yetleast understood episodes in twentieth-century art.', 'Art'),

To understand that strangeness, Bryan Jay Wolf turns to ways of seeing that first developed in the seventeenth century. In a series of provocative readings, Wolf presents Vermeer in bracing new ways, arguing for the painter''s immersion in-rather than withdrawal from-the intellectual concerns of his day. <br>The result is a Vermeer we have not seen before: a painter whose serene spaces and calm subjects incorporate within themselves, however obliquely, the world''s troubles. Vermeer abandons what his predecessors had labored so carefully to achieve: legible spaces, a world of moral clarity defined by the pressure of a hand against a table, or the scatter of light across a bare wall. Instead Vermeer complicated Dutch domestic art and invented what has puzzled and captivated his admirers ever since: the odd daubs of white pigment, dancing across the plane of the canvas; patches of blurred surface, contradicting the painting''s illusionism without explanation; and the querulous silence that endows his women with secrets they dare not reveal. <br>This beautifully illustrated book situates Vermeer in relation to his predecessors and contemporaries, and it demonstrates how powerfully he wrestled with questions of gender, class, and representation. By rethinking Vermeer''s achievement in relation to the early modern world that gave him birth, Wolf takes northern Renaissance and early modern studies in new directions.', 'Art'),

In this now-classic paleographic study of China, Tsuen-Hsuin Tsien traces the development of Chinese writing from the earliest inscriptions to the advent of printing, with specific attention to the tools and media used. Now expanded and updated, this edition includes material that treats the many major documents and ancient Chinese artifacts uncovered over the forty years since the book''s first publication. Substantial contributions from Edward L. Shaughnessy, including a new afterword, complete this long-awaited second edition. <br>"Written on Bamboo and Silk"--the only book of its kind available in English--has long been considered a landmark in its field. Critical in this regard is the excavation of numerous sites throughout China, where hundreds of thousands of documents written on bamboo and silk--as well as other media--were found, including some of the earliest copies of historical, medical, astronomical, military, and religious texts that are now essential to the study of early Chinese literature, history, and philosophy. Discoveries such as these have made the amount of material evidence on the origins and evolution of communication throughout Chinese history exceedingly broad and rich, and yet Tsien succeeds in tackling it all and building on the earlier classic work that changed the course of study and understanding of Chinese paleography.', 'Art'),

His incredible research blows away existing myths while at the same time painting an entirely new picture of an enigma that has baffled the world for over 3,000 years."Andrew Collins, author of From the Ashes of Angels and Twenty-First Century GrailAccording to legend, the Ark of the Covenant was an ornate golden chest that was both a means of communicating with God and a terrible weapon used against the enemies of the ancient Israelites. In order to use it the high priest had to wear a breastplate containing twelve sacred gemstones called the Stones of Fire. These objects were kept in the Great Temple of Jerusalem until they vanished following the Babylonian invasion in 597 B.C.At the ancient ruins of Petra in southern Jordan, Graham Phillips uncovered evidence that thirteenth-century Templars found the Ark and the Stones of Fire, and that they brought these treasures back to central England when they fled the persecution of French king Philip the Fair a century later. The author followed ciphered messages left by the Templars in church paintings, inscriptions, and stained glass windows to what may well be three of the Stones of Fire.

He lives in Coventry, England.<br>Offers compelling evidence that the Knights Templar may have taken the Ark of the Covenant to the British Isles- Presents scientific evidence affirming the powers attributed to the Ark- Traces the Ark and the Stones of Fire from Jerusalem to Jordan and finally to central England, where the Knights Templar hid them in the 14th centuryAccording to legend the Ark of the Covenant was an ornate golden chest that was both a means of communicating with God and a terrible weapon used against the enemies of the ancient Israelites. In order to use it the high priest had to wear a breastplate containing twelve sacred gemstones called the Stones of Fire. These objects were kept in the Great Temple of Jerusalem until they vanished following the Babylonian invasion in 597 B.C.E.At the ancient ruins of Petra in southern Jordan, Graham Phillips uncovered evidence that 13th-century Templars found the Ark and the Stones of Fire, and that they brought these treasures back to central England when they fled the persecution of French king Philip the Fair a century later. The author followed ciphered messages left by the Templars in church paintings, inscriptions, and stained glass windows to what may well be three of the Stones of Fire. When examined by Oxford University scientists these stones were found to possess odd physical properties that interfered with electronic equipment and produced a sphere of floating light similar to ball lightning.The Bible asserts that the Ark had the power to destroy armies and bring down the walls of cities. Now Graham Phillips provides scientific evidence that these claims may be true and offers compelling documentation that the Ark may be located in the Englishcountryside, not far from the birthplace of William Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon.', 'Body, Mind and Spirit'),

Withcontext-based design, designers start not with a preconceived idea of what usersshould do, but with an understanding of what users actually do. Context-based designfocuses on the situation in which the technology will be used -- the activitiesrelating to it and their social contexts. Designers must also realize thatintroduction of the technology itself changes the situation; in order to designworkable systems, the design process must become flexible and adaptive. InActivity-Centered Design, Geri Gay and Helene Hembrooke argue that it is time todevelop new models for HCI design that support not only research and development butalso investigations into the context and motivation of user behavior.Gay andHembrooke examine the ongoing interaction of computer systems use, design practice, and design evaluation, using the concepts of activity theory and related methods asa theoretical framework. Among the topics they discuss are the reciprocalrelationship between the tool and the task, how activities shape the requirements ofparticular tools and how the application of the tools begins to reshape theactivity; differing needs and expectations of participants when new technology isintroduced, examining in particular the integration of wireless handheld devicesinto museums and learning environments; and the effect of the layout of thecomputing space on movement, function, and social interaction.
